        "History": "A 75-year-old man is brought to hospital with an episode of dizziness. He still feels unwellwhen he is seen 30 min after the onset. He was well until the last 6 months, since whenhe has had some falls, irregularly. On some occasions he lost consciousness and is unsurehow long he has been unconscious. On a few occasions he has fallen, grazing his knees,and on others he has felt dizzy and has had to sit down but has not lost consciousness.These episodes usually happened on exertion, but once or twice they have occurred whilesitting down. He recovers over 10\u201315 min after each episode.He lives alone and most of the episodes have not been witnessed. Once his granddaughterwas with him when he blacked out. Worried, she called an ambulance. He looked so paleand still that she thought that he had died. He was taken to hospital, by which time he hadrecovered completely and was discharged and told that he had a normal electrocardiogram(ECG) and chest X-ray.There is no history of chest pain or palpitations. He has had gout and some urinary fre-quency. A diagnosis of benign prostatic hypertrophy has been made for which he is on notreatment. He takes ibuprofen occasionally for the gout. He stopped smoking 5 years ago.He drinks 5\u201310 units of alcohol weekly. The dizziness and blackouts have not been asso-ciated with alcohol. There is no relevant family history. He used to work as an electrician.",
        "Examination": "He is pale with a blood pressure of 96/64 mmHg. The pulse rate is 33/min, regular. Thereare no heart murmurs. The jugular venous pressure is raised 3 cm with occasional rises.There is no leg oedema; the peripheral pulses are palpable except for the left dorsalis pedis.The respiratory system is normal ",
        "Answer": " 1The blackouts do not seem to have had any relationship to posture. They have been a mix-ture of dizziness and loss of consciousness. The one witnessed episode seems to have beenassociated with loss of colour. This suggests a loss of cardiac output usually associated withan arrhythmia. This may be the case despite the absence of any other cardiac symptoms.There may be an obvious flushing of the skin as cardiac output and blood flow return.The normal ECG and chest X-ray when he attended hospital after an episode do not rule outan intermittent conduction problem. On this occasion the symptoms have remained in amore minor form. The ECG shows third-degree or complete heart block. There is completedissociation of the atrial rate and the ventricular rate which is 33/min. The episodes of lossof consciousness are called Stokes\u2013Adams attacks and are caused by self-limited rapid tachy-arrhythmias at the onset of heart block or transient asystole. Although these have beenintermittent in the past he is now in stable complete heart block and, if this continues, theslow ventricular rate will be associated with reduced cardiac output which may causefatigue, dizziness on exertion or heart failure. Intermittent failure of the escape rhythm maycause syncope.1Electrocardiogram showing complete heart block, p-waves arrowed.!The differential diagnosis of transient loss of consciousness splits into neurologicaland vascular causes. A witness is very helpful in differentiation. Neurological causesare various forms of epilepsy, often with associated features. Vascular causes arerelated to local or general reduction in cerebral blood flow. Local reduction mayoccur in transient ischaemic attacks or vertebrobasilar insufficiency. A more globalreduction, often with pallor, occurs with arrhythmias, postural hypotension andvasovagal faints.Differential diagnosisOn examination, the occasional rises in the jugular venous pressure are intermittent \u2018can-non\u2019 a-waves as the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve. In addition,the intensity of the first heart sound will vary The treatment should be insertion of a pacemaker. If the rhythm in complete heart blockis stable then a permanent pacemaker should be inserted as soon as this can be arranged.This should be a dual-chamber system pacing the atria then the ventricles (DDD, dualsensing and pacing, triggered by atrial sensing, inhibited by ventricular sensing) or pos-sibly a ventricular pacing system (VVI, pacing the ventricle, inhibited by ventricular sens-ing). If there is doubt about the ventricular escape rhythm then a temporary pacemakershould be inserted immediately.\n5When a patient suffers transient loss of consciousness, a careful history from a witnessmay help with the diagnosis.Normal examination and ECG do not rule out intermittent serious arrhythmias.Large waves in the jugular venous pressure are usually regular giant v-waves in tricuspidregurgitation or intermittent cannon a-waves in complete heart block"

        "History": "A 34-year-old male accountant comes to the emergency department with acute chestpain. There is a previous history of occasional stabbing chest pain for 2 years. The currentpain had come on 4 h earlier at 8 pm and has been persistent since then. It is central inposition, with some radiation to both sides of the chest. It is not associated with shortnessof breath or palpitations. The pain is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Twoparacetamol tablets taken earlier at 9 pm did not make any difference to the pain.The previous chest pain had been occasional, lasting a second or two at a time and withno particular precipitating factors. It has usually been on the left side of the chestalthough the position had varied.Two weeks previously he had an upper respiratory tract infection which lasted 4 days. Thisconsisted of a sore throat, blocked nose, sneezing and a cough. His wife and two childrenwere ill at the same time with similar symptoms but have been well since then. He has a his-tory of migraine. In the family history his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of51 years and was found to have a marginally high cholesterol level. His mother and two sis-ters, aged 36 and 38 years, are well. After his father\u2019s infarct he had his lipids measured; thecholesterol was 5.1 mmol/L (desirable range/H110215. He is a non-smoker who drinks15 units of alcohol per week.",
        "Examination": "His pulse rate is 75/min, blood pressure 124/78 mmHg. His temperature is 37. There isnothing abnormal to find in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.\n6\nA chest X-ray is normal. The haemoglobin and white cell count are normal. The creatinekinase level is slightly raised. Other biochemical tests are normal Electrocardiogram ",
        "Answer": " 2The previous chest pains lasting a second or two are unlikely to be of any real signifi-cance. Cardiac pain, and virtually any other significant pain, lasts longer than this, andstabbing momentary left-sided chest pains are quite common. The positive family historyincreases the risk of ischaemic heart disease but there are no other risk factors evidentfrom the history and examination. The relief from sitting up and leaning forward is typicalof pain originating in the pericardium. The ECG shows elevation of the ST segment whichis concave upwards, typical of pericarditisand unlike the upward convexity found in theST elevation after myocardial infarction.The story of an upper respiratory tract infection shortly before suggests that this may wellhave a viral aetiology. The viruses commonly involved in pericarditis are Coxsackie Bviruses. The absence of a pericardial rub does not rule out pericarditis. Rubs often vary inintensity and may not always be audible. If this diagnosis was suspected, it is often worthlistening again on a number of occasions for the rub. Pericarditis often involves some adja-cent myocardial inflammation and this could explain the rise in creatine kinase.Pericarditis may occur as a complication of a myocardial infarction but this tends to occura day or more later \u2013 either inflammation as a direct result of death of the underlying heartmuscle, or as a later immunological effect (Dressler\u2019s syndrome). Pericarditis also occursas part of various connective tissue disorders, arteritides, tuberculosis and involvementfrom other local infections or tumours. Myocardial infarction is not common at the age of34 years but it certainly occurs. Other causes of chest pain, such as oesophageal pain ormusculoskeletal pain, are not suggested by the history and investigations.Thrombolysis in the presence of pericarditis carries a slight risk of bleeding into the peri-cardial space, which could produce cardiac tamponade. This arises when a fluid (an effu-sion, blood or pus) in the pericardial space compresses the heart, producing a paradoxicalpulse with pressure dropping on inspiration, jugular venous pressure rising on inspirationand a falling blood pressure. In this case, the evidence suggests pericarditis and thrombol-ysis is not indicated. The ECG and enzymes should be followed, the patient re-examinedregularly for signs of tamponade, and analgesics given.A subsequent rise in antibody titres against Coxsackie virus suggested a viral pericarditis.Symptoms and ECG changes resolved in 4\u20135 days. An echocardiogram did not suggest anypericardial fluid and showed good left ventricular muscle function. The symptoms settledwith rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n8ST segment elevation which is concave upwards is characteristic of pericarditis.Viral pericarditis in young people is most often caused by Coxsackie viruses.Myocarditis may be associated with pericarditis, and muscle function should be assessedon echocardiogram, and damage from creatine kinase and troponin measurements"

Over the next14 years he was often \u2018chesty\u2019 and had spent 4\u20135 weeks a year away from school. Over the past2 years he has developed more problems and was admitted to hospital on three occasions withcough and purulent sputum. On the first two occasions, Haemophilus influenzaewas grownon culture of the sputum, and on the last occasion 2 months previously Pseudomonas aerugi-nosawas isolated from the sputum at the time of admission to hospital. He is still coughing upsputum. Although he has largely recovered from the infection, his mother is worried and askedfor a further sputum to be sent off. The report has come back from the microbiology labora-tory showing that there is a scanty growth of Pseudomonason culture of the sputum.There is no family history of any chest disease. Routine questioning shows that his appetiteis reasonable, micturition is normal and his bowels tend to be irregular.",
        "Examination": "On examination he is thin, weighing 48 kg and 1.6 m (5 ft 6 in) tall.The only finding in the chest is of a few inspiratory crackles over the upper zones ofboth lungs. Cardiovascular and abdominal examination is normal ",
        "Answer": " 3The chest X-ray shows abnormal shadowing throughout both lungs, more marked in bothupper lobes with some ring shadows and tubular shadows representing thickened bronchialwalls. These findings would be compatible with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis. The pul-monary arteries are prominent, suggesting a degree of pulmonary hypertension. The distri-bution is typical of that found in cystic fibrosiswhere the changes are most evident in theupper lobes. Most other forms of bronchiectasis are more likely to occur in the lower lobeswhere drainage by gravity is less effective. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) ofthe lungs is the best way to diagnose bronchiectasis and to define its extent and distribu-tion. In younger and milder cases of cystic fibrosis, the predominant organisms in the spu-tum are Haemophilus influenzaeandStaphylococcus aureus. Later, as more lung damageoccurs,Pseudomonas aeruginosais a common pathogen. Once present in the lungs in cys-tic fibrosis, it is difficult or impossible to remove it completely.Cystic fibrosis should always be considered when there is a story of repeated chest infec-tions in a young person. Although it presents most often below the age of 20 years, diag-nosis may be delayed until the 20s, 30s or even 40s in milder cases. Associated problemsoccur in the pancreas (malabsorption, diabetes), sinuses and liver. It has become evidentthat some patients are affected more mildly, especially those with the less common geneticvariants. These milder cases may only be affected by the chest problems of cystic fibrosisand have little or no malabsorption from the pancreatic insufficiency.\n10!The differential diagnosis in this young man would be other causes of diffusebronchiectasis such as agammaglobulinaemia or immotile cilia. Respiratory functionshould be measured to see the degree of functional impairment. Bronchiectasis in theupper lobes may occur in tuberculosis or in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosisassociated with asthma.Differential diagnosisThe common diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis is to measure the electrolytes in the sweat,where there is an abnormally high concentration of sodium and chloride. At the age of 19 years, the sweat test may be less reliable. It is more specific if repeated after the adminis-tration of fludrocortisone. An alternative would be to have the potential difference acrossthe nasal epithelium measured at a centre with a special interest in cystic fibrosis. Cysticfibrosis has an autosomal recessive inheritance with the commonest genetic abnormality/H9004F508 found in 85 per cent of cases. The gene is responsible for the protein controllingchloride transport across the cell membrane. The commoner genetic abnormalities can beidentified and the current battery of genetic tests identifies well over 95 per cent of cases.However, the absence of /H9004F508 and other common abnormalities would not rule out cys-tic fibrosis related to the less common genetic variants.In later stages, lung transplantation can be considered. Since the identification of thegenetic abnormality, trials of gene-replacement therapy have begun.Milder forms of cystic fibrosis may present in adolescence and adulthood.Milder forms are often related to less common genetic abnormalities.A high-resolution CT scan is the best way to detect bronchiectasis and to define its extent"

        "History": "A 26-year-old teacher has consulted her general practitioner (GP) for her persistent cough.She wants to have a second course of antibiotics because an initial course of amoxicillinmade no difference. The cough has troubled her for 3 months since she moved to a newschool. The cough is now disturbing her sleep and making her tired during the day. Sheteaches games, and the cough is troublesome when going out to the playground and onjogging. In her medical history she had her appendix removed 3 years ago. She had hertonsils removed as a child and was said to have recurrent episodes of bronchitis betweenthe ages of 3 and 6 years. She has never smoked and takes no medication other than anoral contraceptive. Her parents are alive and well and she has two brothers, one of whomhas hayfever.",
        "Examination": "The respiratory rate is 18/min. Her chest is clear and there are no abnormalities in the nose,pharynx, cardiovascular, respiratory or nervous systems.\nChest X-ray is reported as normal.Spirometry is carried out at the surgery and she is asked to record her peak flow rate athome, the best of three readings every morning and every evening for 2 weeks.Spirometry results are as follows:Actual PredictedFEV1(L) 3.4FER (FEV1/FVC) (%) 78 75\u201380PEF (L/min) 470 440\u2013540FEV1: forced expiratory volume in 1 s; FVC, forced vital capacity; FER, forced expira-tory ratio; PEF, peak expiratory flow.1Peak flowrecording at home over 11days ",
        "Answer": " 4The peak flow pattern shows a degree of diurnal variation. This does not reach the diag-nostic criteria for asthmabut it is suspicious. The mean daily variation in peak flow fromthe recordings is 36 L/min and the mean evening peak flow is 453 L/min, giving a meandiurnal variation of 8 per cent. There is a small diurnal variation in normals and a vari-ation of/H1102215 per cent is diagnostic of asthma. In this patient the label of \u2018bronchitis\u2019 as achild was probably asthma. The family history of an atopic condition (hayfever in abrother), and the triggering of the cough by exercise and going out in to the cold also sug-gest bronchial hyper-responsiveness typical of asthma.Patients with a chronic persistent cough of unexplained cause should have a chest X-ray.When the X-ray is clear the cough is likely to be produced by one of three main causes innon-smokers. Around half of such cases have asthma or will go on to develop asthma overthe next few years. Half of the rest have rhinitis or sinusitis with a post-nasal drip. In around20 per cent the cough is related to gastro-oesophageal reflux. A small number of cases willbe caused by otherwise unsuspected problems such as foreign bodies, bronchial \u2018adenoma\u2019,sarcoidosis or fibrosing alveolitis. Cough is a common side-effect in patients treated withangiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.In this patient the diagnosis of asthma was confirmed with an exercise test which wasassociated with a 25 per cent drop in peak flow after completion of 6 min vigorous exer-cise. Alternatives would have been another non-specific challenge such as methacholineor histamine, or a therapeutic trial of inhaled steroids.After the exercise test, an inhaled steroid was given and the cough settled after 1 week.The inhaled steroid was discontinued after 4 weeks and replaced by a /H92522-agonist to usebefore exercise. However, the cough recurred with more evident wheeze and shortness ofbreath, and treatment was changed back to an inhaled steroid with a /H92522-agonist asneeded. If control was not established, the next step would be to check inhaler techniqueand treatment adherence and to consider adding a long-acting /H92522-agonist. In some cases,the persistent dry cough associated with asthma may require more vigorous treatmentthan this. Inhaled steroids for a month or more, or even a 2-week course of oral steroidsmay be needed to relieve the cough. The successful management of dry cough relies onestablishing the correct diagnosis and treating it vigorously.\n12The three commonest causes of persistent dry cough with a normal chest X-ray areasthma (50 per cent), sinusitis and postnasal drip (25 per cent) and reflux oesophagitis(20 per cent).Asthma may present as a cough (cough variant asthma) with little or no airflow obstruction initially, although this develops later.Persistent cough with normal chest examination is unlikely to have a bacterial cause orrespond to antibiotic treatment This page intentionally left blank"

        "Answer": " 5This woman has acute cholecystitis. Cholecystitis is most common in obese, middle-agedwomen, and classically is triggered by eating a fatty meal. Cholecystitis is usually causedby a gallstone impacting in the cystic duct. Continued secretion by the gallbladder leadsto increased pressure and inflammation of the gallbladder wall. Bacterial infection is usu-ally by Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. Ischaemia in the distended gallbladdercan lead to perforation causing either generalized peritonitis or formation of a localizedabscess. Alternatively the stone can spontaneously disimpact and the symptoms spontan-eously improve. Gallstones can get stuck in the common bile duct leading to cholangitisor pancreatitis. Rarely, gallstones can perforate through the inflamed gallbladder wall intothe small intestine and cause intestinal obstruction (gallstone ileus). The typical symptomis of sudden-onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain which radiates into the back. Inuncomplicated cases the pain improves within 24 h. Fever suggests a bacterial infection.Jaundice usually occurs if there is a stone in the common bile duct. There is usuallyguarding and rebound tenderness in the right upper quadrant (Murphy\u2019s sign).In this patient the leucocytosis and raised CRP are consistent with acute cholecystitis. Ifthe serum bilirubin and liver enzymes are very deranged, acute cholangitis due to a stonein the common bile duct should be suspected. The abdominal X-ray is normal; the major-ity of gallstones are radiolucent and do not show on plain films.\n16!The major differential diagnoses of acute cholecystitis include perforated pepticulcer, acute pancreatitis, acute hepatitis, subphrenic abscess, retrocaecal appendicitisand perforated carcinoma or diverticulum of the hepatic flexure of the colon.Myocardial infarction or right lower lobe pneumonia may also mimic cholecystitis.Differential diagnosisThis patient should be admitted under the surgical team. Serum amylase should be meas-ured to rule out pancreatitis. Blood cultures should be taken. Chest X-ray should be per-formed to exclude pneumonia, and erect abdominal X-ray to rule out air under thediaphragm which occurs with a perforated peptic ulcer. An abdominal ultrasound willshow inflammation of the gallbladder wall. The patient should be kept nil by mouth, givenintravenous fluids and commenced on intravenous cephalosporins and metronidazole.The patient should be examined regularly for signs of generalized peritonitis or cholangi-tis. If the symptoms settle down the patient is normally discharged to be readmitted in afew weeks once the inflammation has settled down to have a cholecystectomy.Acute cholecystitis typically causes right upper quadrant pain and a positive Murphy\u2019s sign.Potential complications include septicaemia and peritonitis"

        "Answer": " 6The microcytic, hypochromic anaemia and the altered bowel habit, the only symptomreferable to the gastrointestinal tract, point to a carcinoma of the colon, which would alsoexplain her weight loss. A barium enema revealed a neoplasm in the sigmoid colon, con-firmed by colonoscopy and biopsy. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound showed no pul-monary metastases and no intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy or hepatic metastasesrespectively.She proceeded to a sigmoid colectomy and end-to-end anastamosis, and was regularlyfollowed-up for any evidence of recurrence. Histology showed a grade I tumour.Carcinoma of the colon is increasing in frequency. If it presents at an early stage then the prospect for cure is good. Rectal bleeding, alteration in bowel habit for longer than 1 month at any age, or iron-deficient anaemia in men or postmenopausal women are indi-cations for investigation of the gastrointestinal tract.Smoking is a risk factor for carcinoma of the colon.\n18Carcinoma of the colon can present with few or no symptoms or signs in the gastro-intestinal tract.Carcinoma of the colon must be considered as a cause of iron-deficient anaemia"

During the last 3 months he has had intermit-tent nausea, especially in the mornings, and in the last 3 months the morning nausea hasbeen accompanied by vomiting on several occasions. For 1 month he has noted swellingof his ankles. Despite his weight loss he has recently noticed his trousers getting tighter.He has had no abdominal pain. He has no relevant past history and knows no family history as he was adopted. He takes no medication. From the age of 18 he has smoked 5\u20136 cigarettes daily and drunk 15\u201320 units of alcohol per week. He has been a chef all hisworking life, without exception in fashionable restaurants. He now lives alone as his wifeleft him 1 year ago.",
        "Examination": "He has plethoric features. There is pitting oedema of his ankles. He appears to have lostweight from his limbs, but not his trunk. He has nine spider naevi on his upper trunk. Hispulse is normal and the rate is 92/min. His jugular venous pressure (JVP) is not raised andhis blood pressure is 146/84 mmHg. The cardiovascular and respiratory systems are nor-mal. The abdomen is distended.

        "Answer": " 7This man has abnormal liver function tests which indicate hepatic failure; the hypopro-teinaemia has caused the ascites and ankle swelling. The number of spider naevi is morethan the accepted normal of three. The cause is likely to be alcohol as it is a commoncause of this problem, he is at increased risk through his work in the catering business. Hissymptoms of morning nausea and vomiting are typical, and this would account for hiscushingoid appearance (alcohol increases adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secre-tion) and the macrocytsis on the blood film (due to dietary folate deficiency and a directtoxic action on the bone marrow by alcohol). However his alcohol intake is too low to beconsistent with the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease. When the provisional diagnosis isdiscussed with him though, he eventually admits that his alcohol intake has been at least40\u201350 units per week for the last 20 years and has increased further during the last yearafter his marriage had ended, the reason for this being his drinking.The slight reductions in the sodium and urea reflect a chronic reduced intake of salt andprotein; the rise in bilirubin is insufficient to cause jaundice.Further investigations are the measurement of hepatitis viral serology, which was nega-tive, and an ultrasound of the abdomen. This showed a slight reduction in liver size, andan increase in splenic length of 2\u20133 cm. There was no evidence of a hepatoma. These find-ings indicate that portal hypertension has developed. A liver biopsy, performed to confirmthe diagnosis, assess the degree of histological damage and exclude other pathology,showed changes of cirrhosis.The crucial aim in management is to impress upon the patient the necessity to stop drink-ing alcohol, in view of the degree of liver damage, the presumed portal hypertension andthe risk of oesophageal varices and bleeding, and to effect this by his attending an alco-hol addiction unit. In the short term he should also improve his diet to increase his pro-tein intake. Diuretics could be used to reduce his oedema, but it should be rememberedthat they could cause postural hypotension more easily against this background.His attendance at the addiction unit was fitful, he continued to drink heavily and he died3 years later as a result of a second bleed from oesophageal varices.\n20Patients who drink excessive amounts of alcohol will often disguise this fact in their historyAlcoholic liver disease has a poor prognosis if the alcohol intake is not terminated"

        "Answer": " 8The diagnosis is likely to be acute viral hepatitis. The biochemical results show abnormalliver function tests with a predominant change in the transaminases, indicating a hepato-cellular rather than an obstructive problem in the liver. This might be caused by hepatitis A,B or C. The raised white count is compatible with acute hepatitis. Homosexuality and intra-venous drug abuse are risk factors for hepatitis B and C. Other viral infections such ascytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus are possible.Since the drug ingestion history is unclear, there is a possibility of a drug-induced hepatitis.The prodromal joint symptoms suggest a viral infection as the cause, and this is more com-mon with hepatitis B. Serological tests can be used to see whether there are immunoglobu-lin M (IgM) antibodies indicating acute infection with one of these viruses, to confirm thediagnosis. The reported negative HIV test 6 months earlier makes an HIV-associated condi-tion unlikely although patients are not always reliable in their accounts of HIV tests, andHIV seroconversion should also be considered.Treatment is basically supportive in the acute phase. The prothrombin time in this patientis raised slightly but not enough to be an anxiety or an indicator of very severe disease.Liver function will need to be measured to monitor enzyme levels as a guide to progress.Alcohol and any other hepatotoxic drug intake should be avoided until liver function testsare back to normal. If hepatitis B or C is confirmed by serology then liver function testsand serological tests should be monitored for chronic disease, and antiviral therapy thenconsidered. Rare complications of the acute illness are fulminant hepatic failure, aplasticanaemia, myocarditis and vasculitis. The opportunity should be taken to advise him aboutthe potential dangers of his intake of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol, and to offer himappropriate support in these areas.\n22Viral hepatitis is often associated with a prodrome of arthralgia and flu-like symptoms.Confirmatory evidence should be sought for patients\u2019 reports of HIV test results"

        "Answer": " 9This patient presents with the typical symptoms of end-stage renal failure, namely anorexia,nausea, weight loss, fatigue, pruritus and cramps.The elevated urea and creatinine levels confirm renal failure but do not distinguish betweenacute and chronic renal failure. Usually, in the former, there is either evidence of a systemicillness or some other obvious precipitating cause, e. use of nephrotoxic drugs/prolongedepisode of hypotension, whereas in the latter there is a prolonged history of generalmalaise. If the patient has had previous blood tests measuring serum creatinine, these willbe informative about the progression of deterioration of renal function. In this patient, theanaemia and hyperparathyroidism (raised alkaline phosphatase) are features indicatingchronicity of the renal failure. The normochromic, normocytic anaemia is predominantlydue to erythropoietin deficiency (the kidney is the major source of erythropoietin produc-tion). Hyperparathyroidism is a result of elevated serum phosphate levels due to decreasedrenal clearance of phosphate and reduced vitamin D levels (the kidney is the site of hydrox-ylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to the active form 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). A hand X-ray showing the typical appearances of hyperparathyroidism (erosion of the ter-minal phalanges and subperiosteal erosions of the radial aspects of the middle phalanges),implying long-standing renal failure can be helpful in distinguishing chronic and acuterenal failure.Renal ultrasound is the essential investigation. Ultrasound will accurately size the kidneys,and identify obvious causes for renal failure such as polycystic kidney disease or obstruc-tion causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Asymmetrically sized kidneys suggest refluxnephropathy or renovascular disease. In this case, ultrasound showed two small (8 cm)echogenic kidneys consistent with long-standing renal failure. A renal biopsy in this caseis not appropriate as biopsies of small kidneys have a high incidence of bleeding compli-cations, and the sample obtained would show extensive glomerular and tubulo-interstitialfibrosis and may not identify the original disease. The patient\u2019s renal failure may have beendue to hypertension, or a primary glomerulonephritis such as IgA nephropathy. African-Caribbeans are more prone to develop hypertensive renal failure than other racial groups.Antihypertensive medications are needed to treat her blood pressure adequately, oral phos-phate binders and vitamin D preparations to control her secondary hyperparathyroidism,and erythropoietin injections to treat her anaemia. The case raises the dilemma of whetherdialysis is appropriate in this patient. Hospital-based haemodialysis or home-based peri-toneal dialysis are the options available. Her age and comorbid illnesses preclude renaltransplantation. Conservative management without dialysis may be appropriate in this case.\n24Patients often become symptomatic due to renal failure only when their glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is /H1102115 mL/min, and thus may present with end-stage renal failure.Previous measurements of serum creatinine enable the rate of deterioration of renalfunction to be known.Renal ultrasound is the key imaging investigation"

Inaddition psychiatric disturbances, typically depression, may occur in Cushing\u2019s syndrome.Cushing\u2019s disease is due to a pituitary adenoma secreting adrenocorticotrophic hormone(ACTH). The term \u2018Cushing\u2019s syndrome\u2019 is a wider one, and encompasses a group of dis-orders due to overproduction of cortisol.\n28ACTH secretion by a basophil adenoma of the anterior pituitary gland (Cushing\u2019sdisease).Ectopic ACTH secretion, e. from a bronchial carcinoma, often causing a massiverelease of cortisol and a severe and rapid onset of symptoms.Primary adenoma/carcinoma of the adrenal cortex (suppressed ACTH).Iatrogenic: corticosteroid treatment. This is the commonest cause in day-to-dayclinical practice.Causes of Cushing\u2019s syndrome!\nThis patient\u2019s primary presenting complaint is rapid-onset obesity. The principal causes ofobesity are:geneticenvironmental: excessive food intake, lack of exercisehormonal: hypothyroidism, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, polycystic ovaries and hyper-prolactinaemiaalcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing\u2019s syndrome.This patient should be investigated by an endocrinologist. The first point is to establish isthat this man has abnormal cortisol secretion. There should be loss of the normal diurnalrhythm with an elevated midnight cortisol level or increased urinary conjugated cortisolexcretion. A dexamethasone suppression test would normally suppress cortisol excretion.It is then important to exclude common causes of abnormal cortisol excretion such asstress/depression or alcohol abuse. Measurement of ACTH levels distinguishes betweenadrenal (low ACTH) and pituitary/ectopic causes (high ACTH). This patient drinks alcoholmoderately and has a normal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. His depression seems to bea consequence of his cortisol excess rather than a cause, as he has no psychiatric history.He is having problems with stairs and his social circumstances need to be considered, buthis mobility should improve with appropriate treatment.His ACTH level is elevated. Bronchial carcinoma is a possibility as he is a heavy smokerand the onset of his Cushing\u2019s syndrome has been rapid. However his chest X-ray is nor-mal.

Askeletal X-ray survey was normal, showing no bony metastases and no bony changes ofhyperparathyroidism.Hypercalcaemia of any cause can cause polyuria and polydipsia, and can affect mentalfunction. Long-standing hypercalcaemia (therefore not usually in the case of malignancy)also causes renal stones.

His speech is slightly slurred and he has startedchoking after taking fluids. Past medical history is notable for hypertension for 15 yearsand a myocardial infarction 3 years previously.

There is slight dysarthria ",
        "Answer": " 13This man has motor neurone disease. This is a degenerative disease of unknown causethat affects the motor neurones of the spinal cord, the cranial nerve nuclei, and the motorcortex. The disease usually presents between the ages of 50 and 70 years.Weakness and wasting of the muscles of one hand or arm is the commonest presentation.Weakness is most marked after exertion. Painful cramps of the forearm muscles are com-mon in the early phases of the disease. Patients may present with lower limb weakness orwith dyarthria or dysphagia. The characteristic physical sign of this condition is fascicu-lation, which is an irregular rapid contraction of segments of muscle, caused by denerva-tion of the muscle from a lower motor neurone lesion. Reflexes can be brisk due to loss ofcortical motor neurones. There is no sensory loss.In advanced cases diagnosis is easy, but early cases are more problematic. Limb weaknessworsening with fatigue may be confused with myasthenia gravis. Dysphagia and dysarthriain the elderly are much more commonly due to the pseudobulbar palsy of cerebrovasculardisease. Cervical myelopathy is another common cause of wasting and fasciculation of theupper limbs without sensory loss. Brachial plexus lesions from trauma or invasion by anapical lung tumour (Pancoast tumour) may affect one arm. A predominant motor periph-eral neuropathy causes a symmetrical pattern of weakness and reflexes are reduced.Unfortunately motor neurone disease is a progressive and incurable condition. Patientstend to develop a spastic weakness of the legs. Bulbar palsy causes dysarthria and dys-phasia. Sphincter function is usually not affected. Intellect is generally not affected.There is no curative treatment for this condition. The mean duration of survival from presentation is between 2 and 4 years. The patient and his family will have to be told ofthe diagnosis and prognosis. Support must be given by a multidisciplinary team. As the disease progresses and speech deteriorates communication may be helped by using com-puters. A feeding gastrostomy may be required to enable adequate calorie intake. Non-invasive ventilation can be used to help respiratory failure, but death usually occurs frombronchopneumonia.\n34Motor neurone disease most commonly presents with weakness and wasting of the muscles of one hand.Fasciculation of the muscles is characteristic of this condition.There is no sensory loss in this condition"

The pain began 2 days previously and she says that the knee is now hot,swollen and painful on movement. In the past she has a history of mild osteoarthritis ofthe hips. She has occasional heartburn and indigestion. She had a health check 6 monthspreviously and was told that everything was fine except for some elevation of her bloodpressure which was 172/102 mmHg and her creatinine level, which was around the upperlimit of normal. The blood pressure was checked several times over the next 4 weeks andfound to be persistently elevated and she was started on treatment with 2.5 mg ben-drofluamethizide. The last blood pressure reading was 138/84 mmHg. There is no relevantfamily history. She has never smoked and her alcohol consumption averages four unitsper week. She takes occasional paracetamol for hip pain.",

There is no other abnormality on cardiovascu-lar or respiratory examination. In the hands there are Heberden\u2019s nodes over the distalinterphalangeal joints.The left knee is hot and swollen with evidence of effusion in the joint with a positivepatellar tap.

        "Answer": " 16The clinical picture is one of acute monoarthritis. The patient has a history of some hippains but this and the Heberden\u2019s nodes are common findings in an 80-year-old woman,related to osteoarthritis. The blood results show a raised white cell count and ESR, a raisedblood sugar, and renal function at the upper limit of normal.\n42!The differential diagnosis includes trauma, septic arthritis, gout and pseudogout.Differential diagnoses of pain in the kneeThe recent introduction of a thiazide diuretic for treatment of the hypertension increasesthe suspicion of gout. Pseudogout is caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crys-tals and would be expected to show calcification in the articular cartilage in the kneejoint. The X-rays here show some joint space narrowing but no calcification in the articu-lar cartilage. The fever, high white cell count and ESR are compatible with acute gout. Theraised glucose may also be a side-effect of thiazide diuretics. If this remains after the acutearthritis has subsided then it may need further treatment. Precipitation of gout by thi-azides is more likely in older women, particularly in the presence of renal impairment anddiabetes. It may involve the hands, be polyarticular and can affect existing Heberden\u2019snodes.The serum uric acid level is likely to be raised, but this occurs commonly without evidenceof acute gout. The definitive investigation is aspiration of the joint. The fluid should besent for culture and inspection for crystals. A high white cell count would be expected inan acute inflammatory arthritis. The diagnosis is made from the needle-like crystals ofuric acid which are negatively birefringent under polarized light, unlike the positivelybirefringent crystals of calcium pyrophosphate.In this case the pain in the joint was partly relieved by the aspiration. Treatment with anon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug should be covered by a proton pump inhibitor inview of her history of heartburn and indigestion. The thiazide diuretic was changed to anangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor as treatment for her hypertension, and the bloodglucose settled.A careful drug history is an essential part of the history.Thiazide diuretics can precipitate diabetes and gout, especially in the elderly"

On the first day he felt a little shaky but by the third day hefelt very unwell with the fever and had a feeling of intense cold with generalized shakingat the same time. He felt very sweaty. The whole episode lasted for 2.5 h, and he feltdrained and unwell afterwards. He felt off his food.There is a previous history of hepatitis 4 years earlier and he had glandular fever at theage of 18 years. He smokes 15\u201320 cigarettes each day and occasionally smokes marijuana.He denies any intravenous drug abuse. He drinks around 14 units of alcohol each week.He has taken no other medication except for malaria prophylaxis. He denies any homo-sexual contacts. He has had a number of heterosexual contacts each year but says that allhad been with protected intercourse. He had returned from Nigeria 3 weeks earlier andwas finishing off his prophylactic malaria regime. He had been in Nigeria for 6 weeks aspart of his job working for an oil company and had no illnesses while he was there.",

        "Answer": " 19There is a raised bilirubin with normal liver enzymes, a mild anaemia with a high normalmean corpuscular volume and a low platelet count. This makes a haemolytic anaemialikely. The recent travel to Nigeria raises the possibility of an illness acquired there. Thecommonest such illness causing a fever in the weeks after return is malaria. The incuba-tion period is usually 10\u201314 days. The mild haemolytic anaemia with a low platelet countwould be typical findings. Slight enlargement of liver and spleen may occur in malaria.The diagnosis should be confirmed by appropriate expert examination of a blood film.The most important feature in this 24-year-old man is the fever with what sound like rigors. He has no other specific symptoms. He looks unwell with a tachycardia and sometenderness in the left upper quadrant which could be related to splenic enlargement.Malaria prophylaxis is often not taken regularly. Even when it is, it does not provide com-plete protection against malaria which should always be suspected in circumstances suchas those described here. The risk might be assessed further by finding which parts ofNigeria he spent his time in and whether he remembered mosquito bites. Measures toavoid mosquito bites such as nets, insect repellants and suitable clothing are an importantpart of prevention.He has no history of intravenous drug abuse or recent risky sexual contact to suggest HIVinfection, although this could not be ruled out. HIV seroconversion can produce a fever-ish illness but not usually as severe as this. Later in HIV infection an AIDS-related illnesswould often be associated with a low total lymphocyte count, but this is normal in hiscase. Other acute viral or bacterial infections are possible but are less likely to explain theabnormal results of some investigations.The diagnostic test for malaria is staining of a peripheral blood film with a Wright orGiemsa stain. In this case it showed that around 1 per cent of red cells contained parasites.Treatment depends on the likely resistance pattern in the area visited and up-to-dateadvice can be obtained by telephone from microbiology departments or tropical diseasehospitals. Falciparum malaria is usually treated with quinine sulphate because of wide-spread resistance to chloroquine. A single dose of Fansidar (pyrimethamine and sulfadox-ine) is given at the end of the quinine course for final eradication of parasites. Howeverthere is increasing resistance to quinine, and artemesinin derivatives are increasinglybecoming the first-line treatment for falciparum malaria. In severe cases hyponatraemiaand hypoglycaemia may occur and the sodium here is marginally low. Most of the severecomplications are associated with Plasmodium falciparummalaria. They include cerebralmalaria, lung involvement, severe haemolysis and acute renal failure.No prophylactic regime is certain to prevent malaria.A traveller returning from a malaria endemic region who develops a fever has malariauntil proven otherwise.Treatment should be guided by advice from tropical disease centres.If the malaria species is unknown or the infection mixed, treat as falciparum malaria This page intentionally left blank"

        "Answer": " 20This patient has fever, marked weight loss and a leucoerythroblastic anaemia. The length ofthe symptoms makes infections such as malaria unlikely, although this should be checkedsince she arrived from Nigeria and combined infections are possible. A very importantfinding is that immature red and white cells are seen in the peripheral blood. This leuco-erythroblastic anaemia indicates bone-marrow replacement by tumour or infection forcingimmature cells out into the blood. This woman has miliary tuberculosis. Miliary tubercu-losis is characterized by tuberculous granulomata throughout the body due to widespreaddissemination of tubercle bacilli. It is now usually seen in elderly persons and the diagno-sis is often only made at autopsy. The chest X-ray shows miliary lesions (multiple smallnodules 2\u20135 mm in diameter). These are often subtle or not visible at presentation. Theremay be choroidal tubercles in the eyes on funduscopy and hepatosplenomegaly.!Other infections: visceral abscesses, infective endocarditis, specific organisms (e.brucellosis, actinomycosis or toxoplasmosis) and tropical diseases (e. malaria ortrypanosomiasis).Neoplastic diseases: lymphomas, renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic tumours.Collagen vascular diseases, e. systemic vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemiclupus erythematosus, temporal arteritis.Miscellaneous: recurrent pulmonary emboli, drug fever, sarcoidosis.Differential diagnoses of fevers/H110223 weeks\nThis patient needs an urgent diagnosis. Bronchoscopy with lavage may reveal acid-fastbacilli. Biopsy of her liver and bone marrow may show tubercle bacilli or caseating gran-ulomas. The tissue should also be sent for culture. The tuberculin test may be negativebecause of immunoincompetence induced by the disease. Antituberculous treatment withfour agents must be started immediately once biopsy material has been obtained. In awoman of child-bearing age a pregnancy test should be done, particularly in the face ofmenstrual irregularities. In severely ill patients corticosteroids are of benefit. The totallymphocyte count is low and, in a patient from Africa, HIV infection is a distinct possi-bility. Informed consent should be sought for an HIV test. Tuberculosis is a notifiable dis-ease and the diagnosis should be notified and arrangements made to screen her childrenand any other close contacts.Although eligibility for treatment needs to be assessed by appropriate managers, thiswoman has an acute life-threatening illness and is a potential infective risk to others.Investigation and treatment should be undertaken in the normal way.Miliary tuberculosis is often missed as a cause of weight loss and fever in the elderly.Miliary tuberculosis may present with a leucoerythroblastic anaemia.Always culture biopsy material in patients with pyrexias of unknown origin GENERAL SELF-ASSESSMENTCASESSection 2 This page intentionally left blank"

        "Answer": " 22Peripheral oedema may occur due to local obstruction of lymphatic or venous outflow, orbecause of cardiac, renal, pulmonary or liver disease. Unilateral oedema is most likely tobe due to a local problem, whereas bilateral leg oedema is usually due to one of the med-ical conditions listed above. Pitting oedema needs to be distinguished from lymphoedemawhich is characteristically non-pitting. This is tested by firm pressure with the thumb forapproximately 10 s. If the oedema is pitting, an indentation will be present after pressureis removed. This man has a subacute onset of massive pitting oedema. The major differ-ential diagnoses are cardiac failure, renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, right heart failure(cor pulmonale) secondary to chronic obstructive airways disease or decompensated chronicliver disease. The frothy urine is a clue to the diagnosis of nephrotic syndromeand is com-monly noted by patients with heavy proteinuria.On examination there were no clinical signs to suggest chronic liver disease. The jugularvenous pressure would be expected to be more raised, and there should have been signsof tricuspid regurgitation (prominent \u2018v\u2019 wave, pansystolic murmur loudest on inspiration)and cardiomegaly if the patient had cor pulmonale or biventricular cardiac failure. Thepatient has signs of bilateral pleural effusions which may occur in nephrotic syndrome, ifthere is sufficient fluid retention. The bruising and peri-orbital purpura is classically seenin patients with nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis.The investigations are consistent with the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Nephroticsyndrome is defined by the triad of hypoalbuminaemia (/H1102130 g/L), proteinuria (/H110223 g/24 h),and hypercholesterolaemia. The normochromic, normocytic anaemia is typical of chronicdisease and is a clue to the underlying diagnosis of amyloidosis. Patients with amyloido-sis may have raised serum transaminase levels due to liver infiltration by amyloid.The patient should have a renal biopsy to delineate the cause of the nephrotic syndrome. Theprincipal causes of nephrotic syndrome are listed below. Adults presenting with nephrotic syn-drome should have a renal biopsy. The exception is the patient with long-standing diabetesmellitus, with concomitant retinopathy and neuropathy, who almost certainly has diabeticnephropathy.\n60Diabetes mellitusMinimal change diseaseFocal and segmental glomerulosclerosisMembranous nephropathySystemic lupus erythematosusHIV infectionAmyloidosis/myelomaCauses of nephrotic syndrome!\nIn this case renal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of amyloidosis, and staining was posi-tive for lambda light chains. Immunofixation confirmed the presence of a IgG/H9261parapro-tein in the blood. A bone marrow aspirate showed the presence of an excessive number ofplasma cells, consistent with an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. Patients with amyloi-dosis should have an echocardiogram to screen for cardiac infiltration, and if the facilitiesare available a serum amyloid P scan should be arranged which assesses the distributionand total body burden of amyloid The initial treatment of this patient involves fluid and salt restriction, and diuretics to reducethe oedema. He should be anticoagulated to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis or pul-monary embolus. His hyperlipidaemia should be treated with a statin. Definitive treatmentis by chemotherapy supervised by the haematologists to suppress the amyloidogenic plasmacell clone. In younger patients, bone marrow transplantation may be considered. Patientswith nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis usually progress to end-stage renal fail-ure relatively quickly. Death is most commonly due to cardiac involvement.1Serum amyloid P scan showing uptake predominantly in the spleen.\nBilateral oedema may be due to cardiac, liver or renal disease.All patients presenting with new-onset oedema should have a urinalysis.Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk of pulmonary embolism This page intentionally left blank"

        "Answer": " 25This man has Legionella pneumophilapneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia ismost commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniaeorHaemophilus influenzae, but atyp-ical pneumonias account for about 5\u201315 per cent of cases. The 4-day prodromal illness istypical of Legionellapneumonia (2\u201310 days) compared to pneumococcal pneumonia whichtends to present abruptly with fever and shortness of breath. Legionella infection presentswith malaise, myalgia, headache and fever. Patients may develop diarrhoea and abdominalpain. As the illness progresses the patient develops a dry cough, chest pain, shortness of breathand acute confusion. Other potential complications include nephritis, endocarditis andmyocarditis. On examination, the patient is usually dehydrated, tachycardic and tachypnoeicwith widespread rhonchi and crackles. The diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest atypicalpneumonia, whereas a lobar pattern tends to occur with streptococcal pneumonia. Hypo-natraemia occurs in cases of severe pneumonia and is a poor prognostic factor. Hypocalcaemiais another distinctive biochemical abnormality in this condition. Confusion and raised ureaare markers of severity. The high CRP is consistent with a severe infection, and the lym-phopenia is a clue to the fact that this patient has an atypical pneumonia. The patient\u2019s arte-rial blood gases showed marked hypoxia. This patient presumably acquired his infectionwhile on holiday in Spain. Legionellaoutbreaks have often been due to infected water tanksin warm climates in institutions such as hotels and hospitals.This man is acutely unwell and needs to be admitted to a high-dependency unit. He needsto receive high concentration of inspired oxygen, and also intravenous fluids to correct hisdehydration. He may require mechanical ventilation. He should be started on intravenousantibiotics. These should cover the common community-acquired pneumonias until the pre-cise microbiological diagnosis is obtained and the antibiotics can then be rationalized. Astandard combination is cefuroxime and clarithromycin. Blood cultures should be sent, andblood sent to screen for antibodies to atypical organisms such as Legionella,Mycoplasma,Chlamydia psittaciand influenza. Ten to fourteen days later a further blood sample shouldbe sent and a fourfold rise in antibody titre is evidence of current infection. A faster diag-nosis is made by testing broncheoalveolar lavage fluid, blood and urine for the presence ofLegionellaantigen.\n70Legionellais one of the atypical causes of pneumonia.It should be suspected if there is an outbreak in an institution, or if a case of pneumoniafails to respond to antibiotics.Legionellapneumonia has a 2\u201310-day prodromal illness.Lymphopenia, evidence of nephritis, and a diffuse pattern of infiltrates on chest X-ray areother clues to the diagnosis"

        "Answer": " 27This patient has symptoms and signs typical of early rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoidarthritis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder principally affecting joints in a periph-eral symmetrical distribution. The peak incidence is between 35 and 55 years in women and40 and 60 years in men. It is a disease with a long course with exacerbations and remissions.The acute presentation may occur over the course of a day and be associated with fever and malaise. More commonly, as in this case, it presents insidiously, and this group has aworse prognosis. Rheumatoid arthritis characteristically affects proximal interphalangeal,metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints in the hands, and metatarsophalangeal joints, ankles,knees and cervical spine.Early-morning stiffness of the joints is typical of rheumatoid arthritis. As the disease pro-gresses damage to cartilage, bone and tendons leads to the characteristic deformities of thiscondition. Extra-articular features include rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis causing cutaneousnodules and digital gangrene, scleritis, pleural effusions, diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, pul-monary nodules, obliterative bronchiolitis, pericarditis and splenomegaly (Felty\u2019s syn-drome). There is usually a normochromic normocytic anaemia and raised ESR as seen here.The degree of anaemia and ESR roughly correlate with disease activity. In this case the raisedcreatinine is probably due to the use of diclofenac. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) reduce glomerular filtration rate in all patients. Rarely they can cause an acuteinterstitial nephritis. In patients with lond-standing rheumatoid arthritis, renal infiltrationby amyloid may occur.\n76!Osteoarthritis: characteristically affects the distal interphalangeal as well asproximal interphalangeal and first metacarpophalangeal joints.Rheumatoid arthritis.Systemic lupus erythematosus: usually causes a mild, flitting non-erosive arthritis.Gout: usually starts as a monoarthritis.Seronegative arthritides: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, Reiter\u2019s disease. Theseusually cause an asymmetrical arthritis affecting medium and larger joints as well asthe sacroiliac and distal interphalangeal joints.Acute viral arthritis,e.g rubella: resolves completely.Differential diagnosis of an acute symmetrical polyarthritis\nThis patient should be referred to a rheumatologist for further investigation and manage-ment. The affected joints should be X-rayed. If there has been joint damage, the X-rays willshow subluxation, juxta-articular osteoporosis, loss of joint space and bony erosions. Blood tests should be taken for rheumatoid factor(present in rheumatoid arthritis) and anti-DNA antibodies (present in systemic lupus erythe-matosus). This patient should be given NSAIDs for analgesia and to reduce joint stiffness toallow her to continue her secretarial work. Disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate,leflunomide, gold or penicillamine should be considered unless the patient settles easily onNSAIDs. Anti-tissue necrosis factor (TNF) antibody is effective in some severe cases of rheuma-toid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis tends to spare the distal interphalangeal joints.Systemic symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may precede the joint symptoms.Anaemia and ESR correlate with disease activity.NSAIDs may adversely affect renal function.1X-ray of the foot This page intentionally left blank"

        "History": "A 25-year-old woman is complaining of chest pain. This had been present for 2 years on andoff. The pain settled for a period of 6 months but it has returned over the last 10 months. Thepain is usually on the left side of the chest, radiating to the left axilla. She describes it as atight or gripping pain which lasts for anything from 5 to 30 min at a time. It can come onat any time, and is often related to exercise but it has occurred at rest on some occasions,particularly in the evenings. The pain is usually associated with shortness of breath. It makesher stop whatever she is doing and she often feels faint or dizzy with the pain. Occasionallypalpitations come on after the start of the pain. Detailed questioning about the palpitationsindicates that they are a sensation of a strong but steady heart beat.In her previous medical history she had her appendix removed at the age of 15 years. Atthe age of 30 years she was investigated for an irregular bowel habit and abdominal painbut no specific diagnosis was arrived at. These symptoms still trouble her. She has sea-sonal rhinitis. Two years ago she visited a chemist and had her cholesterol level measured;the result was 4. In her family history her grandfather died of a myocardialinfarction, a year previously, aged 77 years. Several members of her family have hay feveror asthma. She works as a medical secretary. She is married and has no children.",
        "Examination": "On examination, she has a blood pressure of 102/65 mmHg and pulse of 78/min which is reg-ular. The heart sounds are normal. There is some tenderness on the left side of the chest, tothe left of the sternum and in the left submammary area. The respiratory rate is 22/min. Noabnormalities were found on examination of the lungs. She is tender in the left iliac fossa.She asked to be referred for a coronary arteriogram to rule out significant coronaryartery disease.1Electrocardiogram ",
        "Answer": " 28The ECG shown is normal. The pain does not have the characteristics of ischaemic heartdisease. On the basis of the information given here it would be reasonable to explore heranxieties and to reassure the patient that this is very unlikely to represent coronary arterydisease and to assess subsequently the effects of that reassurance. It may well be that sheis anxious about the death of her grandfather from ischaemic heart disease. He may havehad symptoms before his death which were related to her anxieties. From a risk point ofview her grandfather\u2019s death at the age of 77 with no other affected relatives is not a rele-vant risk factor. She has expressed anxiety already by having the cholesterol measured(and found to be normal).She has a history which is suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome with persistent pain,irregular bowel habit and normal investigations. Ischaemic chest pain is usually centraland generally reproducible with the same stimuli. The associated shortness of breath mayreflect overventilation coming on with the pain and giving her dizziness and palpitations.The characteristics of the pain and associated shortness of breath should be explored fur-ther. Asthma can sometimes be described as tightness or pain in the chest, and she has sea-sonal rhinitis and a family history of asthma. Gastrointestinal causes of pain such as refluxoesophagitis are unlikely in view of the site and relationship on occasions to exercise. Thelength of the history excludes other causes of acute chest pain such as pericarditis.The problem of embarking on tests is that there is no simple screening test which candefinitively rule out significant coronary artery disease. Too many investigations mayreinforce her belief in her illness and false-positive findings do occur and may exacerbateher anxieties. However, if the patient could not be simply reassured it might be appropri-ate to proceed with an exercise stress test or a thallium scan to look for areas of reversibleischaemia on exercise or other stress. A coronary arteriogram would not be appropriatewithout other information to indicate a higher degree of risk of coronary artery disease.\n80Ischaemic heart disease characteristically causes central rather than left-sided chest pain.The resting ECG may show signs of ischaemia or previous infarction but is not a verysensitive test for ischaemic heart disease"

She hasa history suggestive of depression since the birth of her son 3 months earlier. She has beenhaving some counselling since that time but has not been on any medication. The previ-ous evening about 10 pm she told her husband that she was going to take some pills andlocked herself in the bathroom.

        "Answer": " 29It is not evident from the history that the patient herself has been asked about any tablets orother agents she has taken. This would be an important area to be sure of. Of the three agentsmentioned, the only one likely to be relevant is paracetamol. Aspirin and temazepam wouldbe likely to produce more symptoms in less than 14 h if they have been taken in significantquantity. However, the salicylate level should certainly be measured; in this case it was notraised. In the absence of drowsiness at this time, it is not necessary to consider temazepamany further.Paracetamol overdosecauses hepatic and renal damage, and can lead to death from acuteliver failure. The severity of paracetamol poisoning is dose related with a dose of 15 gbeing serious in most patients. Patients with pre-existing liver disease and those with ahigh alcohol intake may be susceptible to smaller overdoses.The only significant abnormality on the blood tests is a slightly high prothrombin time andminimally raised alanine aminotransferase (AAT). The prothrombin time increase (expressedalternatively as the international normalized ratio or INR) is a signal that a paracetamol over-dose is likely. It is often the first test to become abnormal when there is liver damage fromparacetamol overdose. If the INR is abnormal at 24 h, then a significant problem is very likely.There are few symptoms in the first 24 h except perhaps nausea, vomiting and abdominal dis-comfort. This may be associated with tenderness over the liver. The liver function tests usu-ally become abnormal after the first 24 h. Maximum liver damage, as assessed by raised liverenzymes and INR occurs at days 3\u20134 after overdose. Acute liver failure may develop betweendays 3 and 5, and renal failure occurs in about 25 per cent of patients with severe hepaticdamage. Rarely, renal failure can occur without serious liver damage.The paracetamol level should be measured urgently; it was found to be high. The evidenceof early liver damage from the INR would in itself suggest that treatment with acetylcys-teine would be appropriate. The earlier this is used the better but it is certainly still worth-while 16 h after the ingestion. In this case a level of paracetamol of 64 mg/L confirmedthat treatment was appropriate and that the risk of severe liver damage was high. Furtheradvice can always be obtained by ringing one of the national poisons information ser-vices. The electrolyte, renal and liver function tests and the clotting studies should bemonitored carefully over the first few days, and referral to a liver unit considered if thereis marked liver dysfunction. Patients with fulminant hepatic failure are considered forurgent liver transplantation.The other areas that need to be addressed in this case are the mental state and the safetyand care of the son and any other children. This is a serious drug overdose. She should beseen by a psychiatrist or other appropriately trained health worker. The question of anypossible risk to the baby should be evaluated before she returns home.\n82Intravenous acetylcysteine and oral methionine are effective treatments for paracetamoloverdose if started early enough.Paracetamol levels can be used to predict problems and guide treatment if the timesince overdose is known.Paracetamol overdose should be suspected in any patient admitted with deranged liverfunction tests and clotting, if no obvious alternative cause is apparent"

        "Answer": " 36This woman has diverticulitis. Colonic diverticula are small outpouchings which are mostcommonly found in the left colon. They are very common in the elderly Western popula-tion probably due to a deficiency in dietary fibre. Symptomatic diverticular disease hasmany of the features of irritable bowel syndrome. Inflammation in a diverticulum istermed diverticulitis. In severe cases, perforation, paracolic abscess formation or septi-caemia may develop. Other potential complications include bowel obstruction. formationof a fistula into rectum or vagina, and haemorrhage.The barium enema from 4 years ago shows evidence of diverticular disease with outpouch-ings of the mucosa in the sigmoid colon. This would be consistent with the long-standinghistory of abdominal pain of colonic type and tendency to constipation. The recent problemswith increased pain, tenderness, fever, raised white cell count and CRP and a mass in the leftiliac fossa would be compatible with an acute exacerbation of her diverticular disease. In hercase there is no evidence of peritonitis which would signal a possible perforation of one ofthe diverticula.The differential diagnosis, with the suggestion of a mass and change in bowel habit, wouldbe carcinoma of the colon and Crohn\u2019s disease. In the absence of evidence of perforationwith leak of bowel contents into the peritoneum (no peritonitis) or obstruction (normalbowel sounds, no general distension), treatment should be based on the presumptive diag-nosis of diverticulitis. A colonoscopy should be performed at a later date to exclude thepossibility of a colonic neoplasm.A CT scan of the abdomen will delineate the mass and suggest whether there is evidenceof local abscess formation. Treatment should include broad-spectrum antibiotics, intra-venous fluids and rest. Further investigations are indicated, including electrolytes, ureaand creatinine, glucose, liver function tests and blood cultures. Repeated severe episodes,bleeding or obstruction may necessitate surgery.\n100Diverticular disease is a common finding in the elderly Western population and may beasymptomatic or cause irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms.Diverticular disease is a common condition; its presence can distract the unwary doctorfrom pursuing a co-incident condition.Diverticulitis needs to be treated with antibiotics to reduce the chance of complicationssuch as perforation or fistula formation occurring"

        "Answer": " 40This boy has sickle cell diseaseand presents with his first serious bony/chest crisis. Sickle celldisease occurs mainly in African black populations and sporadically in the Mediterraneanand Middle East. Haemoglobin S differs from haemoglobin A by the substitution of valine forglutamic acid at position 6 in the /H9252-chain. Sickled cells have increased mechanical fragilityand a shortened survival leading to a haemolytic anaemia, and also can block small vesselsleading to tissue infarction. Sickle cell disease has a very variable clinical course due to acombination of reasons including the haemoglobin F (HbF) level and socio-economic factors.It usually presents in early childhood with anaemia and jaundice due to a chronic haemolyticanaemia, or painful hands and feet with inflammation of the fingers due to dactylitis. Thispatient is having a pulmonary crisis characterized by pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breathand hypoxia. It is usually precipitated by dehydration or infection (in this case, a sore throat).The principal differential diagnoses of a patient presenting with pleuritic pain and breath-lessness are pneumonia, pneumothorax and pulmonary emboli.\n108Thrombotic: causing generalized or localized bony pains, abdominal crises, chestcrises, neurological signs or priapism.Aplastic crises: triggered by parvovirus infection.Haemolytic anaemia.Sequestration crises in children with rapid enlargement of the liver and spleen,usually in young children.Aseptic necrosis: often of the humeral or femoral heads.Renal failure due to renal medullary infarction or glomerular disease.Hyposplenism due to autoinfarction in childhood.Major potential complications of sickle cell disease!\nThis patient should be admitted for rest, intravenous fluids, oxygen and adequate anal-gesia. He has a low arterial pO2and appears cyanosed. Cyanosis is more difficult to detectin the presence of anaemia. Infection should be treated with antibiotics. A blood film willshow sickled erythrocytes and elevated reticulocyte count. The definitive investigation ishaemoglobin electrophoresis which will demonstrate HbS, absent HbA and a variable HbFlevel. Partial exchange transfusion may be needed to reduce the level of his sickle cells toless than 30 per cent. He should be followed up by an expert sickle team since this has beenshown to reduce admissions and improve quality of care. He may benefit from long-termhydroxyurea which raises the HbF level and reduces the number of crises.In African-Caribbean patients, sickle cell disease should be thought of as a cause ofchest or abdominal pain.Patients with sickle cell disease should be looked after in specialized haematology unitswith psychological support available.Severe thrombotic complications should be treated with partial exchange transfusion"

She is a retired teacher. She neither smokes nor drinks alcohol and is onno medication. Her preoperative serum creatinine was 76/H9262mol/L. The initial surgery wasuneventful, and she was given cefuroxime and metronidazole as routine antibiotic prophy-laxis. However the patient developed a prolonged ileus associated with abdominal pain. Onpostoperative day 5, the patient started to spike fevers up to 38.5\u00b0C and was commencedon intravenous gentamicin 80 mg 8 hourly in addition to the other antibiotics. Over thenext 5 days the patient remained persistently febrile, with negative blood cultures. In thelast 24 h, she has also become relatively hypotensive with her systolic blood pressure beingabout 95 mmHg despite intravenous colloids. Her urine output is now 15 mL/h.",

        "Answer": " 42This patient has postoperative acute renal failure due to a combination of intra-abdominalsepsis and aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. Her sepsis is due to an anastomotic leak with alocalized peritonitis which has been partially controlled with antibiotics. Her sepsis syndromeis manifested by fever, tachycardia, hypotension, hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis (lowbicarbonate) and oliguria. The low sodium and high potassium are common in this conditionas cell membrane function becomes less effective. The elevated white count is a marker forbacterial infection and the low platelet count is part of the picture of disseminated intravas-cular coagulation. Jaundice and abnormal liver function tests are common features of intra-abdominal sepsis. Aminoglycosides (gentamicin, streptomycin, amikacin) cause auditory andvestibular dysfunction, as well as acute renal failure. Risk factors for aminoglycoside nephro-toxicity are higher doses and duration of treatment, increased age, pre-existing renal insuffi-ciency, hepatic failure and volume depletion. Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity usually occurs7\u201310 days after starting treatment. Monitoring of trough levels is important although anincrease in the trough level generally indicates decreased excretion of the drug caused by afall in the glomerular flow rate. Thus, nephrotoxicity is already established by the time thetrough level rises.This patient needs urgent resuscitation. She requires transfer to the intensive care unit whereshe will need invasive circulatory monitoring with an arterial line and central venous pres-sure line to allow accurate assessment of her colloid and inotrope requirements. She also needsurgent renal replacement therapy to correct her acidosis and hyperkalaemia. In a haemo-dynamically unstable patient like this, continuous haemofiltration is the preferred method.The patient also needs urgent surgical review. The abdomen should be imaged with eitherultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scanning to try to identify any collection of pus.Once haemodynamically stable, the patient should have a laparotomy to drain any collectionand form a temporary colostomy.\n112Postoperative acute renal failure is often multifactorial due to hypotension, sepsis and theuse of nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides and non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs).Aminoglycoside drugs are extremely valuable for treating Gram-negative infections, butlevels must be monitored to avoid toxicity.Sepsis syndrome must be recognized early and treated aggressively to reduce the mor-bidity and mortality of this condition"

        "Answer": " 44This patient has acute renal failure as a result of rhabdomyolysis. Severe muscle damagecauses a massively elevated serum creatine kinase level, and a rise in serum potassium andphosphate levels. In this case, she has lain unconscious on her left arm for many hours dueto an overdose of alcohol and intravenous heroin. As a result, she has developed severeischaemic muscle damage causing release of myoglobin which is toxic to the kidneys.Other causes of rhabdomyolysis include crush injuries, severe hypokalaemia, excessive exer-cise, myopathies, drugs (e. ciclosporin and statins) and certain viral infections. The urineis dark because of the presence of myoglobin which causes a false-positive dipstick test forblood. Acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis causes profound hypocalcaemia in theoliguric phase due to calcium sequestration in muscle, and reduced 1,25-dihydroxycalciferollevels, often with rebound hypercalcaemia in the recovery phase. This woman\u2019s consciouslevel is still depressed as a result of opiate and alcohol toxicity and she has clinical and radi-ological evidence of an aspiration pneumonia. She has a mixed metabolic and respiratoryacidosis (low pH, bicarbonate) due to acute renal failure and respiratory depression (pCO2ele-vated). Her arterial oxygenation is reduced due to hypoventilation and pneumonia. She alsohas a compartment syndrome in her arm due to massive swelling of her damaged muscles.This patient has life-threatening hyperkalaemia with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes.The ECG changes of hyperkalaemia progress from the earliest signs of peaking of the T-wave, P-wave flattening, prolongation of the PR interval through to widening of the QRScomplex, a sine-wave pattern and ventricular fibrillation. Emergency treatment involvesintravenous calcium gluconate which stabilizes cardiac conduction, and intravenousinsulin/glucose, intravenous sodium bicarbonate and nebulized salbutamol, all of whichtemporarily lower the plasma potassium by increasing the cellular uptake of potassium.However, these steps should be regarded as holding measures while urgent dialysis isbeing organized.The chest X-ray and clinical findings indicate consolidation of the left lower lobe. Thispatient should initially be managed on an intensive care unit. She will require antibioticsfor her pneumonia and will require a naloxone infusion or mechanical ventilation for herrespiratory failure. The patient should have vigorous rehydration with monitoring of hercentral venous pressure. If a good urinary flow can be maintained, urinary pH should bekept at/H110217.0 by bicarbonate infusion which prevents the renal toxicity of myoglobin. Thispatient also needs to be considered urgently for surgical fasciotomy to relieve the com-partment syndrome in her arm.In the longer term, the patient needs counselling and with her boyfriend should be offeredaccess to drug-rehabilitation services. They should also be offered testing for blood-borneviruses (hepatitis B and C and HIV).\n116Acute hyperkalaemia is a life-threatening emergency.A very high creatine kinase level is diagnostic of rhabdomyolysis.As statins are now so widely used, they have become a common cause of rhabdomyoly-sis, especially when used in high dose and in combination with ciclosporin.Aggressive fluid replacement and a forced alkaline diuresis can prevent renal damage inrhabdomyolysis if started early enough"

        "History": "A 55-year-old man is admitted to hospital with headache and confusion. He has a coughand a temperature of 38. He does not complain of any other symptoms. Two monthsearlier he had been admitted with a productive cough and acid-fast bacilli had been foundin the sputum on direct smear. He had lost weight and complained of occasional nightsweats. He had a history of a head injury 10 years previously. He smoked 15 cigarettes aday and drank 40\u201360 units of alcohol each week. He was found a place in a local hostelfor the homeless and sent out after 1 week in hospital on antituberculous treatment withrifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide together with pyridoxine. His chestX-ray at the time was reported as showing probable infiltration in the right upper lobe.",
        "Examination": "He looked thin and unwell and he was slightly drowsy. His mini mental test score was8/10. There were some crackles in the upper zones of the chest posteriorly. His respiratoryrate was 22/min. There were no neurological signs ",
        "Answer": " 49The chest X-ray shows extensive changes in the right upper zone which seem as if theyare likely to be more extensive than those described at the first admission 2 months earl-ier. It is likely that this is a worsening of his pulmonary tuberculosis. This might haveoccurred because he had a resistant organism or, more likely, because he had not taken histreatment as prescribed. Risk factors for development of tuberculosis are poor nutrition,high alcohol intake and immunosuppression (HIV, immunosuppressive therapy). Higher ratesoccur in those from the Indian subcontinent and parts of Africa.The headache and confusion raise the possibility of tuberculous meningitis. Other possi-bilities would be liver damage from the antituberculous drugs and the alcohol, althoughclinical jaundice would be expected, or electrolyte imbalance. If these are not present alumbar puncture would be indicated, provided that there is no sign to suggest raisedintracranial pressure. It would be advisable to do a computed tomography (CT) scan of thebrain first since a fall related to his high alcohol consumption might have led to a sub-dural haemorrhage to give him his headache and confusion.It is now 2 months since the initial finding of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum and the cul-tures and sensitivities of the organism should now be available. These should be checkedto be sure that the organism was Mycobacterium tuberculosisand that it was sensitive to the four antituberculous drugs which he was given. As a check on compliance, bloodlevels of antituberculous drugs can be measured. The urine will be coloured orangy-red bymetabolites of rifampicin taken in the last 8 h or so.Comparison with his old chest X-rays showed extension of the right upper-lobe shadow-ing. It is difficult to be sure about activity from a chest X-ray but extension of shadow-ing is obviously suspicious. \u2018Softer\u2019 more fluffy shadowing is more likely to be associatedwith active disease. A direct smear of the sputum showed that acid-fast bacilli were stillpresent on direct smear. He confirmed that he was not taking his medication regularly. Hisheadache and confusion resolved as he stopped his high alcohol intake. Subsequently theantituberculous therapy should be given as directly observed therapy (DOT) in a thrice-weekly regime supervised at each administration by a district nurse or health visitor.\n128Poor adherence to treatment regimes is the commonest cause of failure of antitubercu-lous and other treatment.Directly observed therapy should be used when there is any doubt about adherence totreatment.Four drugs should be used (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) whenthere is a higher risk of resistant organisms, e. immigrants from Africa, Asia, previouslytreated patients, patients of no fixed abode This page intentionally left blank"

There is norelevant previous medical history except asthma controlled on salbutamol and beclometa-sone. There is no family history of note. She works as a driving instructor and had returnedfrom a 3-week holiday in Australia 3 weeks previously. She had no illnesses while she wasaway. She has taken an oral contraceptive for the last 4 years.",
        "Examination": "She has a temperature of 37.4\u00b0C, her respiratory rate is 24/min, the jugular venous pressureis raised 3 cm, the blood pressure is 110/64 mmHg and the pulse rate 128/min. Peak flow rateis 410 L/min. In the respiratory system, expansion is reduced because of pain. Percussion andtactile vocal fremitus are normal and equal. A pleural rub can be heard over the right lowerzone posteriorly. There are no other added sounds. Otherwise the examination is normal.2 shows her chest X-ray.1Electrocardiogram  ",
        "Answer": " 50This woman has had a sudden onset of pleuritic pain, breathlessness and cough. The phys-ical signs of tachypnoea, tachycardia, raised jugular venous pressure and pleural rub wouldfit with a diagnosis of a pulmonary embolus. The peak flow of 410 L/min indicates thatasthma does not explain her breathlessness.The differential diagnosis would include pneumonia, pneumothorax and pulmonaryembolism. The clinical signs do not suggest pneumothorax or pneumonia. Possible predis-posing factors for pulmonary embolism are the history of a long aeroplane journey 3 weeksearlier, oral contraception and her work involving sitting for prolonged periods. Other pre-disposing factors such as intravenous drug abuse should be considered. The ECG shows asinus tachycardia. The often-quoted pattern of S-wave in lead I, Q-wave and T inversion inlead III (S1Q3T3) is not common except with massive pulmonary embolus. Other signs suchas transient right ventricular hypertrophy features, P pulmonale and T-wave changes mayalso occur. The chest X-ray is normal, ruling out pneumothorax and lobar pneumonia.A ventilation\u2013perfusion lung scan could be done looking for a typical mismatch with anarea which is ventilated but not perfused. This result would have a high probability for adiagnosis of pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary arteriogram has been the \u2018gold standard\u2019for the diagnosis of embolism but is a more invasive test. In cases with a normal chest X-ray and no history of chronic lung disease, equivocal results are less common and it is notusually necessary to go further than the lung scan. In the presence of chronic lung diseasesuch as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or significant asthma, the ventila-tion\u2013perfusion lung scan is more likely to be equivocal and further tests are more often used.This showed a filling defect typical of an embolus in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.3Computedtomography pulmonaryangiogram.A search for a source of emboli with a Doppler of the leg veins may help in some cases,and the finding of negative D-dimers in the blood makes intravascular thrombosis andembolism unlikely Immediate management should involve heparin, usually as subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. The anticoagulation can then transfer to warfarin, continued in a case likethis for 6 months. Alternative modes of contraception should be discussed and advice givenon alternating walking or other leg movements with her seated periods at work. Thrombolysisshould be considered when there is haemodynamic compromise by a large embolus.In the presence of a normal chest X-ray and no chronic lung disease, theventilation\u2013perfusion lung scan has good sensitivity and specificity.The chest X-ray and ECG are often unhelpful in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.CT pulmonary arteriogram is used when ventilation\u2013perfusion scanning is likely to beunhelpful"

His blood pressure was 138/82 mmHg and his pulse rate was 110/min and regular.1Electrocardiogram.He was given analgesia and thrombolysis intravenously and his aspirin and beta-blockerwere continued. His pain settled and after 2 days he began to mobilize. On the fourth dayafter admission, he became more unwell.On examination, now his jugular venous pressure is raised to 6 cm above the manubrioster-nal angle. His blood pressure is 102/64 mmHg, pulse rate is 106/min and regular. His tem-perature is 37. On auscultation of the heart, there is a loud systolic murmur heard allover the praecordium. In the respiratory system, there are late inspiratory crackles at thelung bases and heard up to the mid-zones. There are no new abnormalities to find elsewhereon examination  ",
        "Answer": " 51This 62-year-old man had an anteroseptal myocardial infarctionindicated by Q-wavesin V2 and V3 and raised ST segments in V2, V3, V4 and V5. He became unwell suddenly4 days later having had no initial problems. The late inspiratory crackles are typical ofpulmonary oedema and the chest X-ray confirms this showing hilar flare with some alveo-lar filling, Kerley B lines at the lung bases and blunting of the costophrenic angles withsmall pleural effusions.The problems likely to occur at this time and produce shortness of breath are a furthermyocardial infarction, arrhythmias, rupture of the chordae tendinae of the mitral valve, per-foration of the intraventricular septum or even the free wall of the ventricle, and pulmonaryemboli. The first four of these could produce pulmonary oedema and a raised jugular venouspressure as in this man. Pulmonary embolism would be compatible with a raised jugularvenous pressure but not the findings of pulmonary oedema on examination and X-ray.Acute mitral regurgitation from chordal rupture and ischaemic perforation of the inter-ventricular septum both produce a loud pansystolic murmur. The site of maximum inten-sity of the murmur may differ being apical with chordal rupture and at the lower leftsternal edge with ventricular septal defect, but this differentiation may not be possiblewith a loud murmur. The differentiation can be made by echocardiography.The management of acute ventricular septal defect or chordal rupture would be similar andshould involve consultation with the cardiac surgeons. When these lesions produce haemo-dynamic problems, as in this case, surgical repair is needed, either acutely if the problem isvery severe, or after stabilization with antifailure treatment or even counterpulsation with anaortic balloon pump. Milder degrees of failure with a pansystolic murmur may occur whenthere is ischaemia of the papillary muscles of the mitral valve. This is managed with anti-failure treatment, not surgical intervention, and can be differentiated by echocardiography.\n136The cause of breathlessness after myocardial infarction needs careful evaluation.The signs of ischaemic ventricular septal defect and mitral regurgitation due to chordalrupture after myocardial infarction may be very difficult to differentiate.Patients with angina or myocardial infarction can also present with the radiating painbut no central chest pain, or with only the cardiac effects and no pain at all"

Three weeks earlier, he fell and hit his leg and has some local pain related to this.He is a non-smoker who does not drink any alcohol and has not been on any medication.Twelve years ago he had a myocardial infarction and was put on a beta-blocker but he hasnot had a prescription for this in the last 6 years. Twenty years ago he had a cholecystec-tomy. He used to work as a labourer until his retirement at the age of 63 years.He lives alone in a second-floor flat. His wife died 5 years ago. He has one son who livesin Ireland and whom he has not seen for 3 years.",
        "Examination": "He is tender over the muscles around his limb girdles and there is a little tenderness overthe elbows, wrists and knees. The mouth looks normal except that his tongue appears rathersmooth. He has no teeth and has lost his dentures. There are no other abnormalities to findin the cardiovascular, respiratory or alimentary systems. In the legs, he has a superficiallaceration on the front of the right shin. This is oozing blood and has not healed. There isa petechial rash on some areas of the legs. There are some larger areas of bruising on thearms and the legs which he says have not been associated with any trauma.\n137\nNormalHaemoglobin 10.7 g/dLMean corpuscular volume (MCV) 74 fL 80\u201399 fLWhite cell count 7.6/H11003109/LNeutrophils 6.7/H11003109/LLymphocytes 1 ",
        "Answer": " 52A dietary history is an essential part of any history and is particularly important here wherea number of features point towards a possible nutritional problem. He has been a widowerfor 5 years with no family support. He lives alone on a second-floor flat which may makeit difficult for him to get out. He has lost his dentures which is likely to make it difficult forhim to eat.He has a petechial rash which could be related to coagulation problems, but the platelet countis normal. It would be important to examine the rash carefully to see if it is distributed aroundthe hair follicles. A number of the features suggest a possible diagnosis of scurvyfrom vita-min C deficiency. Body stores of vitamin C are sufficient to last 2\u20133 months. The rash, muscleand joint pains and tenderness, poor wound healing and microcytic anaemia are all featuresof scurvy. The classic feature of bleeding from the gums would not be present in an edentu-lous patient.Plasma measurements of vitamin C are difficult because of the wide range in normal sub-jects. In this patient, replacement with ascorbic acid orally cleared up the symptoms within2 weeks. It would be important to look for other nutritional deficiencies in this situationand to make arrangements to ensure that the situation did not recur after his dischargefrom hospital.\n138A nutritional history should be part of any clinical assessment, particularly in the elderly.Vitamin deficiencies can occur in patients on a poor diet in the absence of any problemwith malabsorption"

There is no other available history. A used packet of paracetamol and dihydrocodeine isfound in one of his pockets but no illicit drugs and no means of identification.On examination he looks pale and smells of alcohol and urine. There are no signs of headinjury and no localizing neurological signs.",
        "Examination": "Tendon reflexes are present and equal except the ankle reflexes which are absent. Plantarresponses are downgoing. The pupils are equal and reactive and the fundi look normal.The observation chart is completed by the nurse in the emergency department.\n139\nPulse: 82/minBlood pressure: 92/56 mmHgTemperature: 35.1Electrocardiogram ",
        "Answer": " 53This man has been unconscious in the open air for an unknown period. Little history isavailable, but the tablets in his pocket might suggest that he has a problem with a painfulcondition. There are a number of possible causes for his unconsciousness including a cere-brovascular problem, deliberate or accidental drug overdose, including alcohol poisoning,metabolic or endocrine disturbance or hypothermia.If this were an overdose, e. of dihydrocodeine, the pupils might well be small. The slowrespiratory rate could be compatible with an opiate excess suppressing ventilation. Theoxygen saturation results show that he is oxygenating himself satisfactorily although itwould be sensible to perform blood gases to measure the arterial partial pressure of CO2(paCO2). It would be appropriate to measure the paracetamol level in the blood and it wouldbe worth giving the opiate antagonist naloxone if there remained a likelihood of overdose.The blood alcohol level should be measured to exclude alcohol poisoning.Most cerebrovascular problems would be expected to produce some localizing neuro-logical signs on careful examination even in an unconscious patient. There are no suchsigns here. The absent ankle jerks might be related to his age.He could have hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma detected by a high glucose and evidenceof haemoconcentration. The blood glucose should be measured together with electrolytesand haematology but the single/H11001of glucose in the urine makes it unlikely that he hashyperglycaemic coma. Liver function and renal function should be measured.He has a slow respiratory rate, low blood pressure and an ECG which shows a wide QRScomplex. The wide complexes on the ECG show an extra deflection at the end of the QRScomplex, the J point. The pulse rate would often beslower than the 82/min in this man and the ECG may show evidence of a tremor fromshivering. The temperature of 35.1\u00b0C does not appear excessively low but this may not bereliable if it is not a true core temperature or has been measured with a normal mercurythermometer (mercury thermometers are not reliable at low temperatures). Indeed, in this case,repeat of the rectal temperature measurement with a low-reading thermometer showed a tem-perature of 30. No paracetamol was detected in the blood and his alcohol level was low at11 mg/100 mL.2Electrocardiogram of resolved hypothermia The management of hypothermia is gradual passive rewarming with replacement of fluidsby warmed colloids as rewarming takes place. The increase of temperature should be0. If this is not achieved by covering the patient with blankets, then warmedinspired oxygen, warm intravenous fluids, bladder or peritoneal lavage might be consid-ered. Drugs and physical disturbance should be limited since the myocardium is often irri-table and susceptible to arrhythmias.\n141Hypothyroidism should be considered as a possible contributor to hypothermia.Even when alcohol is a cause of unconsciousness, other causes must be excluded.The diagnosis of hypothermia requires a thermometer capable of reading low temperatures.J-waves on the ECG are specific signs of hypothermia.Hypothermia in the elderly is treated by gradual passive rewarming This page intentionally left blank"

        "Answer": " 54The most likely diagnosis is malabsorption from coeliac disease.The report of a dimorphicblood film means that there are both small and large cells. This suggests that the anaemiais caused by a combination of the folate deficiency indicated by the red cell folate and byiron deficiency. The Howell\u2013Jolly bodies are dark blue regular inclusions in the red cellswhich are typically found in the blood of patients after splenectomy, or are associated withthe splenic atrophy which is characteristic of coeliac disease. In coeliac disease, there is asensitivity to dietary gluten, a water-insoluble protein found in many cereals. The proximalsmall bowel is the main site involved with loss of villi and an inflammatory infiltrate caus-ing reduced absorption.The MCV is at the upper limit of normal.\n144Folate deficiencyVitamin B12deficiencyExcessive alcohol consumptionHypothyroidismCertain drugs, e. azathioprine, methotrexatePrimary acquired sideroblastic anaemia and myelodysplastic syndromesCauses of macrocytosis in the blood film!\nCoeliac disease is made more likely by a possible positive family history and the originfrom Ireland where coeliac disease is four times as common as in the rest of the UK. Otherdiagnoses which might be considered are anorexia nervosa (her age and sex, commitmentto exercise); she does not appear depressed (a common cause of weight loss and bowel dis-turbance) and the laboratory findings clearly indicate physical disease.Diagnosis of coeliac disease can be confirmed by endoscopy at which a biopsy can be takenfrom the distal duodenum. Typically this will show complete villus atrophy. Antigliadinantibodies are usually positive and can be a useful screening test. The treatment is a gluten-free diet with a repeat of the biopsy some months later to show improvement in the heightof the villi in the small bowel. In some cases, temporary treatment with steroids may beneeded to help recovery. Another common cause of failure to recover the villus architec-ture is poor compliance to the difficult dietary constraints.Howell\u2013Jolly bodies are characteristic of hyposplenism.Coeliac disease can present at any age with non-specific symptoms; absence of abdom-inal pain and/or steatorrhoea are not unusual.Typical features of fat malabsorption may not be evident if the patient eats a diet with little or no fat intake"

One of these was associatedwith right-sided pleuritic chest pain. These have been treated at home by her general prac-titioner (GP). In addition she has a 5-year history of difficulty with swallowing. Initiallythis was mild but it has become progressively worse. She says that food seems to stick inthe low retrosternal area. This applies to all types of solid food. She has lost 5 kg in weightover the last 2 months. Sometimes the difficulty with swallowing seems to improve duringa meal. Recently she has had trouble with regurgitation and vomiting of recognizable food.Three years ago her GP arranged for an outpatient upper gastrointestinal endoscopy whichwas normal. She was reassured, but the problem has increased in severity. There is no otherrelevant medical history or family history. She lived in the north-west coast of the UnitedStates for 4 years up until 10 years ago. She works as a shop assistant. She has never smokedand drinks less than 5 units of alcohol each week. There has been no disturbance of mic-turition. She has always tended to be constipated and this has been a little worse recently.",

(repro-duced with the kind permissionfrom Curtis and Whitehouse,Radiology for the MRCP ,Arnold, 1998 ",
        "Answer": " 55The likely diagnosis is achalasia of the cardia, a primary neurological disturbance of thenerve plexuses at the lower end of the oesophagus. The X-ray shows a dilated fluid-filledoesophagus with no visible gastric air bubble. Endoscopy may be normal in the early stagesas in this case. The oesophagus has now dilated and there has been spill-over of stagnant foodinto the lungs giving her the episodes of repeated respiratory infections. Such aspiration ismost likely to affect the right lower lobe because of the more vertical right main bronchus,although the result of aspiration at night may depend on the position of the patient. The dys-phagia is often variable early on. It tends to be present for all foods, indicating a motilityproblem, and there may initially be some relief from the mechanical load as the oesophagusfills. Dysphagia for bulky, solid foods first usually indicates an obstructive lesion.The diagnosis can be made at this stage by a barium swallow showing the dilated oesopha-gus. Earlier it may require careful cine-radiology with a bolus of food impregnated withbarium, or oesophageal motility studies using a catheter fitted with a number of pressuresensors to detect the abnormal motility of the oesophageal muscle.A similar condition can be produced by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi(Chagas\u2019disease), but this is limited to South and Central America and would not be relevant to herstay in the north-west United States.Other common causes of dysphagia are benign oesophageal structures from acid reflux,malignant structures, external compression or an oesophageal pouch. Achalasia may bemanaged by muscle relaxants when mild, but often requires treatment to disrupt the loweroesophageal muscle by dilatation or surgery.\n146The subjective site of blockage in dysphagia may not reflect accurately the level of theobstruction.Persistent dysphagia without explanation needs investigation by barium swallow orendoscopy"

        "Answer": " 57The likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. The age is typical and sarcoidosis is more common inthose of African-Caribbean origin. The chest X-ray shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.The blood results show a slightly raised calcium level which is related to vitamin D sensi-tivity in sarcoidosis where the granulomas hydroxylate 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. The ESR is raised and some of the liver enzymes are around theupper limit of normal. The skin lesions at the hairline and the nostrils are typical sites forsarcoid skin problems. The eye trouble 6 weeks earlier might also have been a manifesta-tion of sarcoidosis, which can cause both anterior and posterior uveitis.An alternative diagnosis which might explain the findings is tuberculosis. Tuberculosis canalso cause hypercalcaemia although this is much less common than in sarcoid. Tumours,especially lymphoma, might give this X-ray appearance but would not explain the otherfindings. The arthralgia (pains with no evidence of acute inflammation or deformity onexamination) can occur in sarcoid or tuberculosis but again they are commoner in sarcoid.The ESR is non-specific. Arthralgia without deformity in an African-Caribbean man raisesthe possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but this would be much commonerin women and would not cause bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.He is likely to have had BCG (bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e8rin) vaccination at school at around the ageof 12 years, giving a degree of protection against tuberculosis. A tuberculin test should be pos-itive after BCG, strongly positive in most cases of tuberculosis and negative in 80 per cent ofcases of sarcoidosis. The serum level of angiotensin-converting enzyme would be raised inover 80 per cent of cases of sarcoidosis but often in tuberculosis also; the granuloma cellssecrete this enzyme. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest will confirm the extent ofthe lymphadenopathy and show whether there is any involvement of the lung parenchyma.Histology of affected tissue would confirm the clinical diagnosis. This might be obtained by askin biopsy of one of the lesions. A bronchial or transbronchial lung biopsy at fibreoptic bron-choscopy would be another means of obtaining diagnostic histology. In patients with a coughand sarcoidosis the bronchial mucosa itself often looks abnormal, and biopsy will provide thediagnosis. Lung function tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed as a baselineif the diagnosis is confirmed.Steroid treatment would not be necessary for the hilar lymphadenopathy alone, but wouldbe indicated for the hypercalcaemia and possibly for the systemic symptoms.\n152Sarcoidosis is commoner in African-Caribbeans.Typical sites for skin lesions are around the nose and the hairline.Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease and can affect most parts of the body"

Therecommended upper limit for men is 28 units per week.\n158Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathyThin basement membrane diseaseAlport\u2019s syndrome (predominantly affects males)Commonest glomerular causes of microscopic haematuria!IgA nephropathy is the commonest glomerulonephritis in developed countries, and is char-acterized by diffuse mesangial deposits of IgA. Patients often have episodes of macroscopichaematuria concurrent with upper respiratory tract infection. Most cases of IgA nephrop-athy are idiopathic, but this it is also commonly associated with Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpuraand alcoholic cirrhosis. This man has IgA nephropathyin association with alcoholic liverdisease. About 20 per cent of patients with IgA nephropathy will develop end-stage renalfailure after 20 years of follow-up.Thin basement membrane disease is a familial disorder which presents with isolated micro-scopichaematuria, minimal proteinuria and normal renal function that does not deteri-orate. Electron microscopy shows diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membranes(the width is usually between 150 and 225 nm versus 300\u2013400 nm in normal subjects).Alport\u2019s syndrome is a progressive form of glomerular disease, associated with deafnessand ocular abnormalities and is usually inherited as an X-linked dominant condition sothat males are more seriously affected.This patient should have a renal biopsy to reach a histological diagnosis. As the patient isover 50 years old he should have urine cytology/prostate-specific antigen/cystoscopy per-formed to exclude concurrent bladder and prostatic lesions. He needs a liver ultrasound,and liver biopsy should be considered.The patient should be advised to abstain from alcohol, and needs his blood pressure con-trolling. He needs regular follow-up as he is at risk of progressing to dialysis and/or renaltransplantation. The raised creatinine appears modest in terms of the actual figures, but asplasma/serum creatinine does not begin to rise until the glomerular filtration rate is reducedto 50 per cent of normal (irrespective of the patient\u2019s age), the raised creatinine in this caseindicates a serious loss of renal function to approximately 40 per cent of normal. There isno convincing evidence for immunosuppression retarding the progression into renal fail-ure in most patients with IgA nephropathy.Patients with isolated haematuria aged/H1102150 years should be initially referred to anephrologist.Patients with isolated haematuria aged/H1102250 years should be initially referred to a urolo-gist for investigation, to exclude bladder or prostatic disease.Small elevations in serum/plasma creatinine indicate large loss in renal function.Liver damage from a high alcohol intake may occur with no obvious signs and symptoms"

        "Answer": " 60The clinical picture suggests obstruction to outflow from the stomach. This would be com-patible with vomiting of residual food some time after eating and the succussion splash fromthe retained fluid and food in the stomach. The biochemical results fit with this diagnosis.There is a rise in urea but not creatinine, suggesting a degree of dehydration. Sodium, chlor-ide and hydrogen ions are lost in the vomited stomach contents. Loss of hydrochloric acidproduces a metabolic alkalosis. In compensation, hydrogen ions are retained by exchangefor potassium in the kidney and across the cell membranes, so leading to hypokalaemia, andcarbonic acid dissociates to hydrogen ions and bicarbonate. The hypokalaemia indicates a considerable loss of total body potassium, which is mostly in the skeletal muscle, andexplains the patient\u2019s recent weakness.The most likely cause would be a carcinoma of the stomach involving the pyloric antrumand producing obstruction to outflow. A chronic gastric ulcer in this area could producethe same picture from associated scarring, and gastroscopy and biopsy would be neces-sary to be sure of the diagnosis.Gastroscopy may be difficult because of retained food in the stomach. In this case, afterthis was washed out a tumour was visible at the pylorus causing almost complete obstruc-tion of the outflow tract of the stomach. The next step would be a computed tomography(CT) scan of the abdomen to look for metastases in the liver and any suggestion of localspread of the tumour outside the stomach. If there is no evidence of extension or spread,or even to relieve obstruction, laparotomy and resection should be considered. Otherwisechemotherapy and surgical palliation are treatment options.\n160Vomiting food eaten a long time previously suggests gastric outlet obstruction.Mild-to-moderate dehydration tends to increase urea more than creatinine.Prolonged vomiting causes a typical picture of hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis.Carcinoma of the stomach can present without abdominal pain or anaemia"

        "History": "A 35-year-old woman has a year-long history of intermittent diarrhoea which has neverbeen bad enough for her to seek medical help in the past. However, she has become muchworse over 1 week with episodes of bloody diarrhoea 10 times a day. She has had somecrampy lower abdominal pain which lasts for 1\u20132 h and is partially relieved by defaeca-tion. Over the last 2\u20133 days she has become weak with the persistent diarrhoea and herabdomen has become more painful and bloated over the last 24 h.She has no relevant previous medical history. Up to 1 year ago, her bowels were regular.There is no disturbance of micturition or menstruation. In her family history, she thinks oneof her maternal aunts may have had bowel problems. She has two children aged 3 and 8years. They are both well. She travelled to Spain on holiday 6 months ago but has not trav-elled elsewhere.She smokes 10 cigarettes a day and drinks rarely. She took 2 days of amoxicillin after thediarrhoea began with no improvement or worsening of her bowels.",
        "Examination": "Her blood pressure is 108/66 mmHg. Her pulse rate is 110/min, respiratory rate 18/min. Herabdomen is rather distended and tender generally, particularly in the left iliac fossa. Faintbowel sounds are audible.

        "Answer": " 63Bloody diarrhoea 10 times a day suggests a serious active colitis. In the absence of anyrecent foreign travel it is most likely that this is an acute episode of ulcerative colitison topof chronic involvement. The dilated colon suggests a diagnosis of toxic megacolon whichcan rupture with potentially fatal consequences. Investigations such as sigmoidoscopy andcolonoscopy may be dangerous in this acute situation, and should be deferred until there hasbeen reasonable improvement. The blood results show a microcytic anaemia suggestingchronic blood loss, low potassium from diarrhoea (explaining in part her weakness) andraised urea, but a normal creatinine, from loss of water and electrolytes.If the history was just the acute symptoms, then infective causes of diarrhoea would behigher in the differential diagnosis. Nevertheless, stool should be examined for ova, para-sites and culture. Inflammatory bowel disorders have a familial incidence but the patient\u2019saunt has an unknown condition and the relationship is not close enough to be helpful indiagnosis. Smoking is associated with Crohn\u2019s disease but ulcerative colitis is more com-mon in non-smokers.She should be treated immediately with corticosteroids and intravenous fluid replacement,including potassium. If the colon is increasing in size or is initially larger than 5.5 cm thena laparotomy should be considered to remove the colon to prevent perforation. If not, thesteroids should be continued until the symptoms resolve, and diagnostic procedures suchas colonoscopy and biopsy can be carried out safely. Sulphasalazine or mesalazine areused in the chronic maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis after resolution of theacute attack.In this case, the colon steadily enlarged despite fluid replacement and other appropriatetreatment. She required surgery with a total colectomy and ileo-rectal anastomosis. Thehistology confirmed ulcerative colitis. The ileorectal anastomosis will be reviewed regu-larly; there is an increased risk of rectal carcinoma.\n166Bloody diarrhoea implies serious colonic pathology.It is important to monitor colonic dilatation carefully in colitis, and vital to operatebefore rupture.Both Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis can cause a similar picture of active colitis"

Four months earlier she had developed headaches whichwere generalized, throbbing and not relieved by simple analgesics. She does not smoke ordrink alcohol; she is married with three children aged 8, 6 and 2 years. Her husband worksfor a travel firm which requires him to be absent frequently from home.Two months before admission she consulted her general practitioner (GP) for the headaches;tension headaches were diagnosed and codeine phosphate prescribed. This gave no relief,and 3 weeks later she saw her GP again, and the analgesia was changed to a codeine-containing compound analgesic.Her symptoms continued unchanged until 3 days before admission when the headachesbecame worse, her vision became blurred and during the 24 h before admission she notedoliguria and ankle swelling. She presented at the emergency department.The only other relevant medical history is the development of hypertension during the lasttrimester of her third pregnancy which was treated with rest and an antihypertensive.Delivery was spontaneous at term, and the antihypertensive drug was discontinued post-partum. The patient had not attended any postnatal clinics and her blood pressure had notbeen measured at the consultations for her headache.",

        "Answer": " 64This woman has accelerated hypertension, defined by the retinal papilloedema (grade IVretinopathy), and renal failure. At this stage it is not clear whether the renal failure is chronic,acute, or a mixture of acute on chronic.Accelerated hypertension can occur as the initial phase of hypertension or as a develop-ment in chronic hypertension, and can be a feature of either primary (essential) or sec-ondary hypertension. In this case it may have been superimposed on hypertension afterthe birth of her third baby, but the information is not available.\n168The immediate management is to:lower the blood pressure at a gradual rate over 24 h. Rapid reduction to normalfigures can be extremely dangerous as the sudden change can precipitate arterialthrombosis and infarction in the brain, heart and kidneys and occasionally otherorgans. The details of the treatment will vary; either oral or intravenousantihypertensive drugs may be used.control the fluid intake according to fluid loss (urine plus insensible losses) andobserve closely for the development of pulmonary oedema. Should that developthen dialysis will be urgently required as she will not respond to diuretics owing tothe renal failure.Management!\nThe important question with regard to the renal failure is whether this is developing in kid-neys chronically damaged by hypertension or some other undiagnosed renal disease, andhow much of it is reversible. Renal ultrasound, which is swift and non-invasive, will givean accurate assessment of kidney size. In this case they were reduced at 8 cm, and end-stage renal failure followed. The impaired visual acuity recovered completely. It is possiblethat a window of opportunity to treat her hypertension at an earlier stage was lost whenshe presented with the headaches but her blood pressure was not measured; acceleratedhypertension can destroy kidney function in a matter of days or weeks.Accelerated hypertension was previously called malignant hypertension because before thedevelopment of effective antihypertensive drugs its mortality approached 100 per cent. Thisis no longer the case, and, furthermore, it gives patients the unfortunate and false impres-sion that they have a form of cancer. The term should therefore no longer be used.Intrapartum hypertension must be followed up as it may indicate underlying renal dis-ease and the beginning of chronic hypertension, primary or secondary.Patients with headache must always have their blood pressure checked.Avoid the term \u2018malignant hypertension\u2019"

        "Answer": " 68The description of the lesion has the characteristic features of a carcinoma of the skin.The risk factors are his age, the many years exposure to sunlight as farmer, and the chronicimmunosuppression. There is an increased risk of several different types of malignancy inpatients on chronic immunosuppression, and skin cancer is now well recognized as a fre-quent complication of chronic immunosuppression unless preventative measures are used.With improving survival rates for transplant patients in general, there is a potential increasein the incidence and prevalence of skin malignancy. Patients on long-term immunosuppres-sion for whatever reason should be strongly advised to avoid direct exposure to sunlight asmuch as possible, and certainly not to sunbathe, and to use high-factor barrier creams. Theyshould cover their skin in the lighter months (April to September inclusive in the northernhemisphere) \u2013 no shorts, sleeveless tops or shirts, and a hat to protect the scalp and forehead.This is particularly irksome but even more important for children and young adults whohave a potentially longer period of exposure to sunlight ahead of them. The damage causedto skin by sunlight is cumulative and irreversible, and when transplanted at the age of 50years this patient had already had over 30 years\u2019 occupational exposure to ultraviolet radi-ation. His immunosuppression needs to continue and should be kept at as low a dose as iscompatible with preventing rejection of his transplant.The diagnosis of the lesion was made by biopsy, which showed a squamous cell cancer. Thiswas treated by wide excision and skin grafting. An essential part of the follow-up is regularreview, at least 6-monthly, of the skin to detect any recurrence, any new lesions or malig-nant transformation of the solar hyperkeratoses.\n178Ultraviolet radiation is a cumulative risk factor for skin cancer.Preventative measures to reduce exposure to sunlight are an important part of the man-agement of patients on long-term immunosuppression"

The pain has two typical features of carcinoma of thepancreas: relief by sitting forward and radiation to the back. An alternative diagnosiscould be gallstones but the pain is not typical.As with obstruction of any part of the body the objective is to define the site of obstruc-tion and its cause. The initial investigation was an abdominal ultrasound which showed adilated intrahepatic biliary tree, common bile duct and gallbladder but no gallstones. Thepancreas appeared normal, but it is not always sensitive to this examination owing to itsdepth within the body.Further investigation of the region at the entrance of the common bile duct into the duode-num and head of the pancreas was indicated and was undertaken by computed tomography(CT) scan. It showed a small tumour in the head of the pancreas causing obstruction to thecommon bile duct, but no extension outside the pancreas. No abdominal lymphadenopathywas seen. No hepatic metastases were seen on this investigation or on the ultrasound.The patient underwent partial pancreatectomy with anastamosis of the pancreatic duct tothe duodenum. The jaundice was rapidly relieved.

The superficial reflexes andtendon reflexes were normal and the plantar response was flexor ",
        "Answer": " 70This patient has hysteria, now renamed as dissociative disorder.

Inany case of dissociative disorder the diagnosis is one of exclusion; in this case the neuro-logical examination excludes organic lesions. It is important to realize that this disorder isdistinct from malingering and factitious disease. The condition is real to patients and theymust not be told that they are faking illness or wasting the time of staff.The management is to explain the dissociation \u2013 in this case it is between her will to moveher leg and its failure to respond \u2013 as being due to stress, and that there is no underlyingserious disease such as multiple sclerosis. A very positive attitude that she will recover isessential, and it is important to reinforce this with appropriate physical treatment, in thiscase physiotherapy.The prognosis in cases of recent onset is good, and this patient made a complete recoveryin 8 days.Dissociative disorder frequently presents with neurological symptoms, and the commonestof these are convulsions, blindness, pain and amnesia. Clearly some of these will requirefull neurological investigation to exclude organic disease.\n182Dissociative disorder frequently presents as a neurological illness.The diagnosis of dissociative disorder must be one of exclusion"

        "History": "A 72-year-old woman develops a chest infection and is treated at home with doxycyclineby her general practitioner (GP). She lives alone but one of her daughters, a retired nurse,moves in to look after her. The patient has a long history of rheumatoid arthritis which isstill active and for which she has taken 7 mg of prednisolone daily for 9 years. She takesparacetamol occasionally for joint pain. There is no other relevant past or family history.When the GP visited he found the blood pressure to be 138/82 mmHg.For 5 days since 2 days before starting the antibiotics she has been feverish, anorexic andconfined to bed. Her daughter has made her drink plenty of fluids. On the fifth day shebecame drowsy and her daughter had increasing difficulty in rousing her, so she called anambulance to take her to the emergency department.",
        "Examination": "She is small (assessed as 50 kg) but there is no evidence of recent weight loss. Her temper-ature is 38. She is drowsy and responds to commands, but will not answer simple ques-tions. There is a global reduction in muscle tone but no focal neurological signs. Her pulseis 118/min, blood pressure 104/68 mmHg and the jugular venous pressure is not raised.There is no ankle swelling. In the chest there are bilateral basal crackles and wheezes. Herjoints show slight active inflammation and deformity, in keeping with the history ofrheumatoid arthritis.\n183\nNormalHaemoglobin 11.7 g/dLMean corpuscular volume (MCV) 86 fL 80\u201399 fLWhite cell count 13.0/H11003109/LPlatelets 376/H11003109/L 150\u2013440/H11003109/LSodium 125 mmol/L 135\u2013145 mmol/LPotassium 4.7 mmol/LCreatinine 131/H9262mol/L 70\u2013120/H9262mol/LGlucose 4 ",
        "Answer": " 71The likeliest diagnosis is secondary acute hypoaldosteronismdue to failure of the hypo-thalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis caused by the long-term prednisolone. This is a commonproblem in patients on long-term steroids and arises when there is a need for increasedglucocorticoid output, most frequently seen in infections or trauma, including surgery, orwhen the patient has prolonged vomiting and therefore cannot take the oral steroid effect-ively. It presents as here with drowsiness and low blood pressure.The hyponatraemia is another result of the superimposed illness. It is probably due to acombination of reduced intake of sodium owing to the anorexia, and dilution of plasmaby the fluid intake. In secondary hypoaldosteronism the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosteronesystem is intact and should operate to retain sodium. This is in contrast to acute primaryhypoaldosternism (Addisonian crisis) when the mineralocorticoid secretion fails as well asthe glucocorticoid secretion, causing hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. Acute secondaryhypoaldosteronism is often but erroneously called an Addisonian crisis.Spread of the infection should also be considered, the prime sites being to the brain, witheither meningitis or cerebral abscess, or locally to cause a pulmonary abscess or empyema.The patient has a degree of immunosuppression due to her age and the long-term steroid.The dose of steroid is higher than may appear at first sight as the patient is only 50 kg;drug doses are usually quoted for a 70 kg male, which in this case would equate to 10 mgof prednisolone, i. an increase of 40 per cent on her dose of 7 mg.The treatment is immediate empirical intravenous infusion of hydrocortisone and saline.The patient responded and in 5 h her consciousness level was normal and her blood pres-sure had risen to 136/78 mmHg. Chest X-ray showed bilateral shadowing consistent withpneumonia, but no other abnormality.\n184Secondary hypoaldosteronism is a medical emergency and requires immediate empir-ical treatment.Patients on long-term steroids should have the dose increased when they have intercur-rent illnesses, and replaced systemically when they have persistent vomiting"

The pain is in the right loin and radiates to the right flank and groin andthe right side of the vulva. It is colicky and has made her vomit several times. Since the ageof 18 years she has had recurrent urinary tract infections, mainly with dysuria and fre-quency, but she has had at least four episodes of acute pyelonephritis affecting right and leftkidneys separately and together. She has not had gross haematuria nor passed stones perurethra. There is no other past history. Her mother had frequent urinary tract infections anddied at the age of 61 of a stroke. Over the years the patient has taken irregular intermittentprophylactic antibiotics, but for only approximately a total of 20 per cent of the time. Sheworks in a travelling fairground and has no general practitioner (GP). Access to any previ-ous medical records is not possible as she cannot remember the details of where she was seenor treated.

        "Answer": " 72The pain\u2019s acute onset, colicky nature and radiation are typical of ureteric colic, the like-liest cause of which is a stone. Renal stones can cause infection, or chronic infection cancause scarring which provides a nidus for stone formation.The high fever and leucocytosis indicate that she has another episode of acute pyelonephritis.The patient is in renal failure; at this stage it is not clear whether this is all acute, with previ-ous normal renal function, or whether there is underlying chronic renal failure with an acuteexacerbation. Both kidneys are affected, as renal function remains normal if one kidney ishealthy. Until proved otherwise it must be assumed that any element of acute renal failure isdue to obstruction by a stone; her illness is too short for significant prerenal failure due tofluid loss or septicaemia. Acute pyelonephritis per secan cause acute renal failure but this isvery uncommon.She has hypertension. Her blood pressure is raised, but pain and anxiety could easily accountfor that. However, there is grade I retinopathy.The overall interpretation at this point is that she is a medical emergency with acutepyelonephritis in an obstructed urinary tract.The most important investigation now is an ultrasound of the urinary tract. This showsstones in both kidneys; the left kidney is reduced in size to 10 cm, with a scar at its upperpole, and is not obstructed; the right kidney is larger at 11 cm but is obstructed as shownby a dilated renal pelvis and ureter; its true size would be less than 11 cm.The immediate management is an intravenous antibiotic to treat Gram-negative bacteria, E. colibeing the commonest cause of urinary tract infections, after urine and blood samplesare taken for culture. Intravenous fluids should be given (she has vomited) according to fluidbalance, carefully observing urine output.The obstruction must be relieved without delay; the method of choice is percutaneousnephrostomy and drainage. In this procedure a catheter is inserted under imaging guidancethrough the right loin into the obstructed renal pelvis. Not only will this relieve the obstruc-tion but it allows the later injection of X-ray contrast to define the exact site of obstruction(percutaneous nephrostogram). This was done 48 h later and showed hold-up of the contrastat the vesico-ureteric junction, a typical place for a stone to lodge. The patient passed thestone shortly afterwards, as often happens if it is small enough; otherwise it would have tobe removed surgically. Her fever, pain and leucocytosis rapidly resolved. Her renal functionimproved but stabilized at a creatinine of 180/H9262mol/L, i. she has chronic renal failure.Blood biochemistry revealed no underlying abnormality to cause the stones: calcium,phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and uric acid were normal. The probable cause of herrenal disease is reflux nephropathy because of her sex, history of recurrent infections andthe scar on the left kidney. There is a familial tendency for this disease, and her mothermay have had it. The patient\u2019s children should be screened for it in infancy.Long-term management comprises prophylactic antibiotics, immediate treatment of acuteurinary infections, control of hypertension and regular measurement of renal function.These should be supervised from a fixed base, despite the patient\u2019s peripatetic existence.\n186An obstructed and infected urinary system is an emergency requiring immediate treatment.Prophylactic treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections should be considered inevery case, although not necessarily indicated in every one"

It was asharp pain in the right side of the chest. The pain was made worse by breathing. It settledover the next few hours but there is still a mild ache in the right side on deep breathing.She felt a little short of breath for the first hour or two after the pain came on but nowonly feels this on stairs or walking quickly. She has had a dry cough throughout the 6 h.She smokes 15 cigarettes a day and drinks 10 units of alcohol a week. She uses marijuanaoccasionally. She is on no medication. Four years ago something very similar happened;she is not sure but thinks that the pain was on the left side of the chest on that occasion.There is no relevant family history.",
        "Examination": "She is not distressed or cyanosed. Her pulse is 88/min and blood pressure 128/78 mmHg, res-piratory rate is 20/min. Heart sounds are normal. In the respiratory system the trachea andapex beat are not displaced. Expansion seems normal, as is percussion. There is decreasedtactile vocal fremitus and the intensity of the breath sounds is reduced over the right side ofthe chest. There are no added sounds on auscultation ",
        "Answer": " 73The chest X-ray shows a large right pneumothorax. There is a suggestion of a bullouslesion at the apex of the right lung. Pneumothoraces are usually visible on normal inspira-tory films but an expiratory film may help when there is doubt. There is no mediastinaldisplacement on examination or X-ray, movement of the mediastinum away from the sideof the pneumothorax would suggest a tension pneumothorax. Although she had symp-toms initially, these have settled down as might be expected in a fit patient with no under-lying lung disease. A rim of air greater than 2 cm around the lung on the X-ray indicatesat least a moderate pneumothorax because of the three-dimensional structure of the lungwithin the thoracic cage represented on the two-dimensional X-ray.The differential diagnosis of chest pain in a young woman includes pneumonia and pleurisy,pulmonary embolism and musculoskeletal problems. However, the clinical signs and X-rayleave no doubt about the diagnosis in this woman. Pneumothoraces are more common intall, thin men, in smokers and in those with underlying lung disease. Further investigationssuch as computed tomography (CT) scan are not indicated unless there is a suggestion ofunderlying lung disease.There is a suggestion that she may have had a similar episode in the past but it may havebeen on the left side. There is a tendency for recurrence of pneumothoraces, about 20 percent after one event and 50 per cent after two. Because of this, pleurodesis should be con-sidered after two pneumothoraces or in professional divers or pilots.The immediate management is to aspirate the pneumothorax through the second inter-costal space anteriorly using a cannula of 16 French gauge or more, at least 3 cm long. Smallpneumothoraces with no symptoms and no underlying lung disease can be left to absorbspontaneously but this is quite a slow process. Up to 2500 mL can be aspirated at one time,stopping if it becomes difficult to aspirate or the patient coughs excessively. If the aspir-ation is unsuccessful or the pneumothorax recurs immediately, intercostal drainage to anunderwater seal or valve may be indicated. Difficulties at this stage or a persistent air leakmay require thoracic surgical intervention. This is considered earlier than it used to besince the adoption of less invasive video-assisted techniques. In this woman the apicalbulla was associated with a persistent leak and required surgical intervention throughvideo-assisted minimally invasive surgery.Marijuana has been reported to be associated with bullous lung disease, and she should beadvised to avoid it. Tobacco smoking increases the risk of recurrence of pneumothorax.\n188The patient should not be allowed to fly for at least 1 week after the pneumothorax hasresolved with full expansion of the lung (2 weeks after a traumatic pneumothorax).The risk of recurrence will be reduced by stopping smoking"

        "History": "An 86-year-old man has been in a residential home for 3 years since his wife died. He wasunable to look after himself at home because of some osteoarthritis in the hips limiting hismobility. Apart from his reduced mobility, which has restricted him to a few steps on aframe, and a rather irritable temper when he doesn\u2019t get his own way, he has had no prob-lems in residential care.However, he has become much more difficult over the last 36 h. He has accused the staffof assaulting him and stealing his money. He has been trying to get out of his bed and hischair, and this has resulted in a number of falls. On some occasions his speech has beendifficult to understand. He has become incontinent of urine over the last 24 h. Prior to thishe had only been incontinent on one or two occasions in the last 6 months.The duty doctor is called to see him and finds that he is rather sleepy. When roused heseems frightened and verbally aggressive. He thinks that there is a conspiracy in the wardand that the staff are having secret meetings and planning to harm him. He is disorien-tated in place and time although reluctant to try to answer these questions.He is a non-smoker and drinks 1\u20132 units a month. On a routine blood test 8 years ago hewas diagnosed with hypothyroidism and thyroxine 100 mg daily is the only medication heis taking. The staff say that he has taken this regularly up to the last 36 h and his recordsshow that his thyroid function was normal when it was checked 6 months earlier.The staff say that he is now too difficult to manage in the residential home. They feel thathe has dementia and that the home is not an appropriate place for such patients.",
        "Examination": "There is nothing abnormal to find apart from blood pressure of 178/102 mmHg and limi-tation of hip movement with pain and a little discomfort in the right loin.\n189\nNormalThyroxine 125 nmol/L 70\u2013140 nmol/LThyroid-stimulating hormone 1.0 mU/LBlood glucose 6 ",
        "Answer": " 74This is not the picture of dementia. The acute onset with clouding of consciousness, hal-lucinations, delusions, restlessness and disorientation suggest an acute confusional state,delirium. There are many causes of this state in the elderly. It can be provoked by drugs,infections, metabolic or endocrine disorders, or other underlying conditions in the heart,lungs, brain or abdomen.There is no record of any drugs except thyroxine, although this should be rechecked to ruleout any analgesics or other agents that he might have had access to or that might not beregarded as important.The thyroid abnormality is not likely to be relevant. The lack of replacement for 2 dayswill not have a significant effect and the normal results 6 months earlier make this anunlikely cause of his current problem. The sugar is normal. Other metabolic causes suchas renal failure, anaemia, hyponatraemia and hypercalcaemia need to be excluded.The falls raise the possibility of trauma, and a subdural haematoma could present in thisway. However, it seems that the falls were a secondary phenomenon. The most likely causeis that he has a urinary tract infection. There is blood and protein in the urine, he has becomeincontinent and he has some tenderness in the loin which could fit with pyelonephritis. Weare not told whether he had a fever, and the white cell count should be measured.If this does seem the likely diagnosis it would be best to treat him where he is, if this is safeand possible. He is likely to be more confused by a move to a new environment in hospi-tal. There is every likelihood that he will return to his previous state if the urinary tractinfection is confirmed and treated appropriately, although this may take longer than theresponse in temperature and white cell count. Treatment should be started on the pre-sumption of a urinary tract infection, while the diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy andculture of the urine. The most likely organism isEscherichia coli, and an antibiotic suchas trimethoprim would be appropriate, although resistance is possible and advice of thelocal microbiologist may be helpful. From the confusion point of view he should be treatedcalmly, consistently and without confrontation. If medication is necessary, small doses ofa neuroleptic such as haloperidol or olanzapine would be appropriate.\n190Acute changes in mental state need to be explained even in the elderly with baselinemental problems.In delirium, consciousness is clouded, disorientation is usual and delusions maydevelop. The onset is acute. In dementia, there is an acquired global impairment ofintellect, memory and personality, but consciousness is typically clear"

        "History": "A 21-year-old man is brought in to hospital at 5 pm. He was found unconscious in his flatby his girlfriend. She had last seen him at 8 pm the evening before when they came homeafter Christmas shopping. When she came to see him the next afternoon she found himunconscious on the floor of the bathroom. He had been well previously, with no knownmedical history. There was a family history of diabetes mellitus in his father and one ofhis two brothers.His girlfriend had said that he had shown no signs of unusual mood on the previous day.He had his end of term examinations in psychology coming up in 1 week and was anx-ious about these but his studies seemed to be going well and there had been no problemswith previous examinations.He is a non-smoker. He drinks around 10 units of alcohol most weeks with occasionalbinges. He has taken ecstasy tablets in the past but has never used intravenous drugs.",
        "Examination": "He looked pale. There were no marks of recent intravenous injections. His pulse was92/min, blood pressure 114/74 mmHg, respiratory rate 22/min. There were no abnormalitiesto find in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. In the nervous system there was noresponse to verbal commands. Appropriate withdrawal movements were made in responseto pain. The reflexes were brisk and symmetrical, plantars were downgoing. The pupilswere dilated but responsive to light. In the fundi, the optic discs appeared swollen ",
        "Answer": " 75This young man has been brought in unconscious having been well less than 24 h previ-ously. The most likely diagnoses are related to drugs or a neurological event. The first partof the care should be to ensure that he is stable from a cardiac and respiratory point of view.His respiratory rate is a little high. Blood gases should be measured to monitor the oxy-genation and ensure that the carbon dioxide level is not high, suggesting hypoventilation.The family history of diabetes raises the possibility that his problem is related to this.However, the speed of onset makes hyperglycaemic coma unlikely. One would expect aslower development with a history of thirst and polyuria over the last day or so. However,the blood sugar should certainly be checked. Hypoglycaemia comes on faster but wouldnot occur as a new event in diabetes mellitus. It might occur as a manifestation of a rarecondition such as an insulinoma. Other metabolic causes of coma such as abnormal levelsof sodium or calcium should be checked.A neurological problem such as a subarachnoid haemorrhage is possible as a suddenunexpected event in a young person. Where the level of consciousness is so affected, somelocalizing signs or subhyaloid haemorrhage in the fundi might be expected. If no othercause is evident from the initial investigations, a computed tomography (CT) scan mightbe indicated.The most likely cause is that the loss of consciousness is drug related. Despite the lack ofany warning of intent beforehand, drug overdose is common and the question of avail-ability of any medication should be explored further. This would be likely to be a sedativedrug. If there is any suspicion of this then levels of other drugs which might need treat-ment should be measured, e. aspirin and paracetamol.The other possibility in somebody brought in unconscious is that they are suffering fromcarbon monoxide poisoning. The fact that it is winter and he was found in the bathroomwhere a faulty gas-fired heater might be situated increases this possibility. Patients withcarbon monoxide poisoning are usually pale rather than the traditional cherry-red colourassociated with carboxyhaemoglobin. Papilloedema can occur in severe carbon monoxidepoisoning and might account for the swollen appearance of the optic discs on funduscopy.Measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin showed a level of 32 per cent. He was treated with highlevels of inspired oxygen and made a slow but full recovery over the next 48 h. Mannitol forcerebral oedema and hyperbaric oxygen are considerations in the management. The problemwas traced to a faulty gas water heater which had not been serviced for 4 years.\n192Drug overdose is the commonest cause of unconsciousness in young people, but otherdiagnoses must always be considered.Carboxyhaemoglobin levels should be measured in patients found unconscious indoorsor in vehicles and after known exposure to smoke.In carbon monoxide poisoning marked hypoxia may be present in the absence ofcyanosis"

        "Answer": " 77This woman has a 5-year history of intermittent upper abdominal pain. Her current painhas lasted longer than previous episodes and on examination she is jaundiced. The acutepain on inspiration while palpating in the right upper quadrant is a positive Murphy\u2019s signof inflammation of the gallbladder. The relative bradycardia in the presence of the acuteillness is likely to be related to the beta-blocker therapy (atenolol) rather than hypothy-roidism or any other problem. The dark urine would fit with increased conjugated biliru-bin because of obstruction. The conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and excreted in theurine. Without conjugated bilirubin entering the bowel one would expect pale stools.Her investigations show a raised bilirubin. The alanine aminotransferase is slightly raisedbut the main abnormalities in the liver enzymes are high values of alkaline phosphataseand gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. This is the pattern of obstructive jaundicewhichcan be caused by mechanical obstruction by tumour or by gallstones, or by adverse effectsof some drugs, e. phenothiazines, flucloxacillin. The drugs she is taking are not likelycauses of liver problems.The previous episodes of pain and fever over the last 5 years are likely to have been chole-cystitis secondary to gallstones. If the gallbladder were to be palpable on examination thiswould suggest an alternative diagnosis of malignant obstruction, since by this time theseprevious episodes of cholecystitis would usually have caused scarring and contraction ofthe gallbladder. In order to produce obstructive jaundice one or more of her gallstones musthave moved out of the gallbladder and impacted in the common bile duct. Migration ofgallstones from the gallbladder occurs in around 15 per cent of cases.Her thyroid condition seems to be stable and not relevant to the current problem. Her anginais indicative of coronary artery disease and needs to be considered when treatment is beingplanned for her gallstones. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be part of her management.Only a minority of gallstones are radio-opaque and visible on a plain radiograph so thenext investigation should be an ultrasound of the liver and biliary tract. Ultrasound willshow dilatation of the biliary tree but is not so reliable for identifying common bile ductstones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the best tool for this,and sphincterotomy with or without stone retrieval may be possible to remove stonesobstructing the common bile duct.\n196Obstructive jaundice with a dilated, palpable gallbladder is likely to be caused by carcinomaat the head of the pancreas (Courvoisier\u2019s sign).Obstructive jaundice causes preferential elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.When the main rise is in alanine aminotransferase, this indicates primarily hepatocellulardamage"

        "History": "A 36-year-old man presents to his general practitioner (GP) complaining of a fever andgeneralized aching in muscles around the back and legs. At first he thought that this wasprobably influenza but the symptoms have now been present for 9 or 10 days. For 3 dayshe had diarrhoea but this has settled now. He has complained of a sore mouth over the lastweek or so which has made it difficult to eat, but he has not felt very hungry during thistime and thinks he may have lost a few kilograms in weight. Around the time that thesymptoms started he noticed a mild erythematous rash over his chest and abdomen butthis has faded.He has visited the practice occasionally in the past for minor complaints. He has been tothe practice to obtain vaccinations for visits to Vietnam and Thailand over the last 3 years.His last travel abroad was 3 months ago. He smokes 10 cigarettes daily, drinks 20\u201330 unitsof alcohol weekly and takes no illicit drugs. He had no other relevant medical or family his-tory. He works as a solicitor. He is single and lives alone. He has had a number of hetero-sexual and homosexual relationships in the past. Twelve months ago he had an HIV testwhich was negative.",

        "Answer": " 78This seems likely to be an infective problem which has gone on for over a week. Thelength of the history makes influenza unlikely. The other positive features are the cervicallymphadenopathy and the oral ulceration. The temperature is still up and there has beena rash which has resolved. The blood results are all normal including the test for glandu-lar fever (infectious mononucleosis) which was a reasonable diagnosis with these features.The previous homosexual contact increases the possibility of sexually transmitted infec-tions. It is possible that travel to Vietnam and Thailand may have been associated withhigh-risk sexual exposure. He is known to have had a negative HIV test 12 months ago.However, it is quite possible that this might be an HIV seroconversion illness. In aroundhalf of those who acquire the virus this occurs within 4\u20136 weeks of acquisition. Althoughthe HIV test will still be negative, this can be diagnosed by finding the presence of the HIVvirus or its p24 antigen in the blood. He should have been counselled about precautionsto reduce the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases at the time of the HIVtesting 12 months before.The picture might fit for secondary syphilis which occurs 6\u20138 weeks after the primarylesion. However, in that case the rash would often be more extensive and the lymph nodesare not usually tender. A serological test for syphilis should certainly be performed.Other viral illnesses are possible. Hepatitis may present with this more general prodrome butthe normal liver function tests make this much less likely. Lymphoma can present with lym-phadenopathy and fever but the oral ulceration and the rash are not typical of lymphoma. Ifthe serological tests proved negative, lymph node biopsy might be considered.In this case, tests for an HIV viraemia were positive. Antiretroviral treatment at the timeof known or high-risk exposure is useful in reducing the risk of infection. At this stage,treatment is supportive with explanation and arrangements for monitoring of viral load.\n198A seroconversion illness occurs in around 50 per cent of those acquiring HIV infection.The severity varies.In cases of known or high-risk exposure, such as needlestick injuries, an immediatecourse of antiretroviral treatment is often indicated. Immediate advice should be sought"

        "Answer": " 79This woman\u2019s confusion is due to hyponatraemia. There are many causes of confusion inthe elderly but the very low sodium level of 113 mmol/L in this case is an adequateexplanation. Her serum is profoundly hypo-osmolar. In her case, osmolality can be calcu-lated from the following equation:2/H11003([Na/H11001]/H11001[K/H11001])/H11001[urea]/H11001[glucose]/H11005241 mosmol/kg (normal range:278\u2013305 mosmol/kg).Hyponatraemia may be asymptomatic, but when it falls rapidly or reaches very low levels(below 120 mosmol/kg) it can cause confusion, anorexia, cramps, fits and coma. Hypo-natraemia is associated with hypovolaemia when there is excess loss of fluid and sodium(sweating, burns, diarrhoea and vomiting), or when there is renal loss of sodium and water(diuretic use, Addison\u2019s disease).Hyponatraemia with hypervolaemia occurs when there is excess retention of water.Normally, the dilutional fall in plasma osmolality suppresses arginine vasopressin (AVP,antidiuretic hormone) secretion which allows excretion of excess water. In congestive car-diac failure and cirrhosis with ascites, baroreceptors register reduced perfusion causing AVPsecretion, but in most other cases of hyponatraemia there is an inability to suppress AVPsecretion normally. In rare cases of primary polydipsia, the huge water intake may over-whelm this mechanism, and in severe renal failure the kidneys cannot excrete a water load.The syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) occurs in relationto malignancy, neurological disorders or pneumonia. Circulating volume is usually normal.Normovolaemia with hyponatraemia also occurs after administration of too much intra-venous hypotonic fluid and in hypothyroidism.The low plasma sodium, potassium and urea in this patient are consistent with water excess.Measurement of urinary sodium and osmolality is useful. In primary polydipsia the urinecan be maximally diluted to/H11021100 mosmol/kg, whereas in states with excess AVP the urineosmolality is usually/H11022320 mosmol/kg while plasma osmolality is low. Urinary sodium isusually/H1102125 mmol/L in hypovolaemic states, but/H1102240 mmol/L in SIADH where patients arenormovolaemic and the rate of sodium excretion depends on dietary intake and taking ofdiuretics. Diuretic-induced hyponatraemia tends to occur within a few weeks of startingtreatment, and occurs mainly in elderly women often concurrently on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which inhibit water excretion. The clinical and biochemicalpicture in this woman is consistent with diuretic-induced hyponatraemia.\n200Low plasma osmolality with high urinary osmolality suggests excess ADH production.Volume depletion with urinary sodium/H1102220 mmol/L suggests water and sodium lossthrough the kidneys (renal failure, diuretic use, Addison\u2019s disease).Volume depletion and low urinary sodium (/H1102120 mmol/L) suggests volume and sodiumloss extrarenally, e. vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating"

Shehad woken that morning to notice that her calf was swollen and found it painful to put herfoot to the ground. There was no history of recent air travel or long-distance car journeys.She is otherwise well, is not breathless and has no chest pain. She has had no previousmedical illnesses other than some cartilage problems in the knees. In her obstetric historyshe has had two first-trimester miscarriages and has not had any successful pregnancies.There is no family history of note. The patient is married.

        "Examination": "She is a little overweight. Her left leg is clearly swollen, with a 4 cm difference in circum-ference around the left calf measured 10 cm below the tibial tuberosity. There is tendernesson palpation of the calf. The left calf is slightly warmer than the right. There is a small effu-sion in the right knee, which is not hot or painful.

        "Answer": " 80The most likely clinical diagnosis in this patient is a left deep vein thrombosis(DVT). Themain differential diagnoses of an acutely swollen leg are a ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst, traumaand acute cellulitis. Other causes of chronically swollen legs are obesity, lymphoedema,congestive cardiac failure and previous DVTs (postphlebitic). The knee cartilage problemsraise the possibility of ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst, and the active lifestyle is compatible withmuscle trauma such as a ruptured plantaris but there is no story of an acute onset.The raised D-dimers are not helpful since there are many causes. D-dimers are helpfulwhen negative in making the diagnosis of DVT much less likely. The history of miscarriageand the raised activated partial thrombopastin time suggest the presence of antiphospho-lipid syndrome (lupus anticoagulant) which should be investigated together with serologicaltests for systemic lupus erythematosus.\n202In assessing the clinical likelihood of a deep vein thrombosis scoring systems areavailable:Active cancer 1 pointParalysis or recent plaster immobilization 1 pointMajor surgery or confined to bed for/H110223 days in last 4 weeks 1 pointLocal tenderness along venous system 1 pointSwelling of entire leg 1 pointCalf/H110223 cm larger than other side 1 pointCollateral superficial veins 1 pointOedema greater than in contralateral leg 1 pointAlternative diagnosis as or more likely than DVT \u20132 pointsPretest clinical probability0 or less/H11005low1\u20132/H11005intermediate/H110222/H11005highThis patient has a score of 3.Scoring system for DVT diagnosis!\nDehydration, prolonged inactivity, bedrest, post-surgical, obesity.Malignancy: cancers of the lung, pancreas, breast, prostate and gut are particularlyassociated. Pelvic malignancy causing compression can directly lead to venousthrombosis.Oral contraceptives: oestrogens increase the risk.Genetic causes: protein C/S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, homocystinuriaand factor V Leiden mutation.Beh\u00e7et\u2019s syndrome: a diagnostic triad of iritis, orogenital ulceration and DVTs.Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.Major risk factors for DVTs!\nWhen a patient presenting with a DVT is young, or where there is no obvious underlyingcause or where there is a strong family history or a history of recurrent events, underly-ing risk factors should be investigated. This woman had oral contraceptive use and thepresence of antiphospholipid antibodies as risk factors for her DVT. Antiphospholipid anti-bodiesmay be present as part of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or may be an isolated finding, primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Although the antibodies prolongthe activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) they predispose to thrombosis. Recurrent miscarriages, as in this patient, may be a feature. Patients may present with idiopathicrecurrent DVT, arterial gangrene, livedo reticularis, cerebral infarcts, chorea and multi-infarct dementia.Doppler ultrasound of her leg veins will confirm the diagnosis of DVT. A thrombophiliascreen should be sent. Lupus serology should also be performed to define if the antiphos-pholipid antibodies are part of SLE in this patient.This patient should be immediately anticoagulated either with intravenous heparin or sub-cutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent proximal propagation of the thrombusand pulmonary emboli. The patient should be started on warfarin. Patients with antiphos-pholipid antibodies require lifelong anticoagulation and consultation with a haematologistto prevent further thrombotic events.\n203Young patients with venous thromboses should be investigated for underlying causes.Patients with antiphospholipid antibodies require lifelong anticoagulation.Clinical diagnosis of a deep vein thrombosis is insensitive and has poor specificity This page intentionally left blank"

        "Answer": " 81The blood count shows anaemia with a low MCV indicating a microcytic anaemia. Thehigh red cell count with low haemoglobin shows that the haemoglobin content of the cellsis reduced. The low serum iron and ferritin with a high total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)confirm that this is related to true iron deficiency. The blood film confirms that the cellsare microcytic and low in haemoglobin (hypochromasia). In anaemia of chronic diseasethe cells may be microcytic and serum iron low but the TIBC would be low also and fer-ritin normal. The diagnosis is most likely to be a peptic ulcer.The commonest cause of iron-deficiency anaemia in a man is gastrointestinal blood loss. Ina premenopausal woman menstrual blood loss would be the most common cause. Theabdominal pains would be consistent with those from a peptic ulcer, especially a duodenalulcer when there is more often some relief from food. The diagnosis should be establishedby endoscopy because alternative diagnoses such as carcinoma of the stomach cannot beruled out from the history. The site of the blood loss causing the iron deficiency should beestablished. At the same time the presence of Helicobacter pylorishould be investigated.In this case, an endoscopy confirmed an active duodenal ulcer and samples were positiveforHelicobacter pylori. This is associated with gastritis and with over 90 per cent of duo-denal ulcers. Tests of expired breath and serum antibodies are alternative diagnostic tests. pyloriwas treated by a combined regime of omeprazole for 6 weeks and triple ther-apy with lansoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 7 days. He was given strongrecommendations to stop smoking and to address his excessive alcohol consumption. Theiron deficiency was corrected by additional oral iron which was continued for 3 monthsto replenish the iron stores in the bone marrow. Repeat endoscopy to show healing con-firms the original diagnosis of benign ulceration.\n206Various antibiotic regimes have been shown to temporarily remove Helicobacter pyloriand prevent or postpone recurrence of symptoms and ulceration.Replenishment of iron stores in the bone marrow needs 3 months\u2019 treatment with oraliron after the haemoglobin has returned to normal.Ferritin is an acute-phase protein and will be raised in the presence of acute illness evenin the presence of iron deficiency"

        "Answer": " 82This woman has the typical clinical symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica/giant cell arteritis.Most patients are over 65 years. The onset of symptoms is often sudden. Patients may pres-ent primarily with polymyalgia-type symptoms (proximal muscle pain and stiffness mostmarked in the mornings) or temporal arteritis symptoms (severe headaches with tendernessover the arteries involved). Patients may have systemic symptoms such as general malaise,weight loss and night sweats. Characteristically, the ESR is very elevated (at least 40 mm/h)and there is a mild anaemia and leucocytosis. The liver enzymes are often slightly raised. Inpolymyalgia, the main symptoms are muscle stiffness and pain which may simulate muscleweakness. The creatine kinase is normal, unlike in polymyositis.The diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica is essentially a clinical diagnosis. A very elevatedESR is useful. Around 25 per cent of patients with giant cell arteritis have polymyalgia.When there are headaches and giant cell arteritis is suspected, a temporal artery biopsyshould be performed. However, the histology may be normal because the vessel involve-ment with inflammation is patchy. Nevertheless, a positive result provides reassuranceabout the diagnosis and the need for long-term steroids.This patient has clear evidence of giant cell arteritis (also known as temporal arteritisalthough other vessels are involved), and is at risk of irreversible visual loss either due toischaemic damage to the ciliary arteries causing optic neuritis, or central retinal arteryocclusion. The patient should immediately be started on high-dose prednisolone (before thebiopsy result is available). The steroid dose should be slowly tapered according to clinicalfeatures and ESR, but is likely to need to be continued for around 2 years. Bone protectionmeasures should be part of the management.\n208!PolymyositisSystemic vasculitisSystemic lupus erythematosusParkinsonismHypothyroidism/hyperthyroidismOsteomalaciaDifferential diagnoses of proximal muscle weakness and stiffness\nPolymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis often co-exist.Patients with these conditions have markedly elevated ESR levels.There is a risk of blindness in giant cell arteritis, and steroids should be started immediately"

He beganto feel unwell around 11.45 pm and vomited twice, brought up his meal and several pintsof lager and initially felt better. Over the next hour or so he retched violently on severaloccasions and around 1 am vomited up bright red blood. He says that he noticed just asmall amount of blood on the first occasion but considerably more the second time.There is no relevant previous medical history or family history. He smokes 10 cigarettes aday, takes occasional marijuana and drinks 2\u20133 units of alcohol a week.",

        "Answer": " 84The most likely diagnosis is a tear of the mucosa in the lower oesophagus or upper stom-ach causing haematemesis (a Mallory\u2013Weiss lesion). This is produced from the mechan-ical trauma of violent vomiting or retching. In this case, it may have been triggered by anunaccustomed large alcohol intake.The estimation of blood loss is often difficult from the patient\u2019s story. Haematemesis is afrightening symptom and the amount may be overestimated. The haemoglobin level hereis normal and it is unlikely to be helpful in an acute bleed. If it were low at this stage itwould be more likely to imply chronic blood loss. The first signs of significant blood losswould be likely to be tachycardia and a postural drop in blood pressure. His pulse is fastbut this may well be related to anxiety.Other possible causes of haematemesis are gastritis or peptic ulcer. The story of retching andvomiting of gastric contents with no blood on several occasions before the haematemesis ischaracteristic of Mallory\u2013Weiss syndrome. This is usually a benign condition which does notneed intervention. Definitive diagnosis requires upper gastrointestinal endoscopy but is notalways necessary in a typical case. Occasionally the blood loss is more substantial or thesplit in the wall may be deeper than just the mucosa, leading to perforation.Management in this case was with careful observation, intravenous fluid to replace lostvolume from vomiting. Blood was taken for blood grouping in case of more substantialhaemorrhage but transfusion was not necessary. He was treated with an anti-emetic and anH2-blocker. The vomiting settled and there was no more bleeding. He decided to indulgeless at future parties.\n212A history of violent retching or vomiting without blood before haematemesis suggests anupper gastrointestinal mucosal tear.It is difficult to be sure of the degree of blood loss in haematemesis because the patientwill find it difficult to quantitate the volume of blood, and the amount of blood still inthe gastrointestinal tract is unknown.In some surveys alcohol is linked directly to around one-quarter of acute medicaladmissions"

Her appetite has been nor-mal but she has lost some weight. Her change in personality has been noticed by her hus-band and friends. She feels constantly restless and has difficulty concentrating on a subjectfor more than a few moments.

        "Answer": " 85Although anxiety might produce some of these symptoms and signs, they fit much betterwith a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. The neck should be examined carefully and in this casethere was a smooth goitre with no bruit over it. Blood tests showed a very low thyroxine-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and a high free thyroxine (T4), confirming the diagnosis ofhyperthyroidism due to a diffuse toxic goitre (Graves\u2019 disease). Hyperthyroidism may mimican anxiety neurosis with marked restlessness, irritability and distraction. The most helpfuldiscriminatory symptoms are weight loss despite a normal appetite and preference for coldweather. The most helpful signs are goitre, especially with a bruit audible over it, resting sinustachycardia or atrial fibrillation, tremor and eye signs. Eye signs which may be presentinclude lid retraction (sclera visible below the upper lid), lid lag, proptosis, oedema of the eye-lids, congestion of the conjunctiva and ophthalmoplegia. Atypical presentations of thyrotox-icosis include atrial fibrillation in younger patients, unexplained weight loss, proximalmyopathy or a toxic confusional state. The weakness here is suggestive of a proximal myopa-thy. The very low TSH level indicates a primary thyroid disease rather than overproduction ofTSH by the anterior pituitary.\n214Diffuse toxic goitre (Graves\u2019 disease)Toxic nodular goitremultinodular goitre (Plummer\u2019s disease)solitary toxic adenomaOver-replacement with thyroxineCommon causes of hyperthyroidism!Blood should be sent for thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin which will be detected inpatients with Graves\u2019 disease. Medical treatment for thyrotoxicosis involves the use of theantithyroid drugs carbimazole or propylthiouracil. These are given for 12\u201318 months butthere is a 50 per cent chance of disease recurrence on stopping the drugs. If this happensradioiodine or surgery is indicated. Beta-blockers can be used to rapidly improve the symp-toms of sympathetic overactivity (tachycardia, tremor) while waiting for the antithyroiddrugs to act. Radio-iodine is effective but there is a high incidence of late hypothyroidism.Surgery is indicated if medical treatment fails, or if the gland is large and compressing sur-rounding structures. In severe exophthalmos there is a risk of corneal damage and ophthal-mological advice should be sought. High-dose steroids, lateral tarsorrhaphy or orbitaldecompression may be needed.Thyrotoxicosis may be difficult to differentiate from an anxiety state.The commonest causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves\u2019 disease or a toxic nodular goitre"

Cranial and bulbarnerve paralysis may occur and can cause respiratory failure. The CSF protein is usuallyraised, but the cell count is usually normal, although there may be a mild lymphocytosis.The disorder is probably due to a cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity reaction causingmyelin to be stripped off the axons by mononuclear cells.\n216!Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndromeLead poisoningDiphtheriaCharcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy)PoliomyelitisDifferential diagnoses of motor neuropathy\nAn acute-onset neuropathy suggests:Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndromeporphyriamalignancysome toxic neuropathiesdiphtheriabotulism.This patient should be referred to a neurologist for further investigation and management.

She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 8 years ago and has been onthyroxine replacement but has not had her blood tests checked for a few years. Her othercomplaints are of itching for 2\u20133 months, but she has not noticed any rash. She says thather mouth has been dry and, on direct questioning, thinks her eyes have also felt dry.There has been no disturbance of her bowels or urine although she thinks that her urinehas been rather \u2018strong\u2019 lately. She is 14 years postmenopausal. There is a family historyof thyroid disease and of diabetes. She does not smoke, and drinks two glasses of sherryevery weekend. She has never drunk more than this regularly. She has taken occasionalparacetamol for headaches but has been on no regular medication other than thyroxineand some vitamin tablets she buys from the chemist.",

        "Answer": " 88The liver function tests show a predominantly obstructive picture with raised alkalinephosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, while cellular enzymes are only slightlyraised. The symptoms and investigations are characteristic of primary biliary cirrhosis, anuncommon condition found mainly in middle-aged women. In the liver there is chronicinflammation around the small bile ducts in the portal tracts. Hypercholesterolaemia, xan-thelasmata and xanthomata are common. The dry eyes and dry mouth may occur as partof an associated sicca syndrome. Itching occurs because of raised levels of bile salts, andcan be helped by the use of a binding agent such as cholestyramine which interferes withtheir reabsorption. The presence of antimitochondrial antibodies in the blood is typical ofprimary biliary cirrhosis. These antibodies are found in 95 per cent of cases.Hypothyroidism might explain some of her symptoms but the normal thyroid-stimulatinghormone (TSH) level shows that her current dose of 150/H9262g thyroxine is providing adequatereplacement. The thyroid antibodies reflect the autoimmune thyroid disease which is asso-ciated with other autoantibody-linked conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis.The diagnosis is confirmed by a liver biopsy. This should only be carried out after an ultra-sound confirms that there is no obstruction of larger bile ducts. Ultrasound will help torule out other causes of obstructive jaundice although the clinical picture described hereis typical of primary biliary cirrhosis. No treatment is known to affect the clinical courseof this condition.\n222The pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities usually reflects either an obstructive or hepatocellular pattern.Symptoms such as itching have a wide differential diagnosis. Dealing with the under-lying cause, wherever possible, is preferable to symptomatic treatment"

Over the past few weeks he has developed pain in his right foot.His general practitioner diagnosed cellulitis and he has received two courses of oralantibiotics. This has made him feel unwell and he has complained to his wife of fatigue,anorexia and feeling thirsty. In his medical history he had a myocardial infarction 2 yearsago.

        "Answer": " 89This man has signs of dehydration and the high urea with a normal creatinine is consistentwith this. The blood glucose level is not given but the picture is likely to rep-resenthyperglycaemic ketoacidotic coma.The key clinical features on examination aredehydration and hyperventilation, and the triggering problem with the infection in thefoot. A persistently high sugar level induced by his infected foot ulcer causes heavy glyco-suria triggering an osmotic diuresis. This leads to hypovolaemia and reduced renal bloodflow causing prerenal uraemia. The extracellular hyperosmolality causes severe cellulardehydration, and loss of water from his brain cells is the cause of his coma. Decreasedinsulin activity with intracellular glucose deficiency stimulates lipolysis and the productionof ketoacids. He has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to accumulation of ketoacids(acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate). The anion gap is calculated from the equation:[Na/H11001]/H11001[K/H11001]/H11002([Cl/H11002]/H11001[HCO3/H11002])and is normally 10\u201318 mmol/L; in this case it is 31.

Rapid fluid replacement with intravenous normal salineand potassium supplements should be started. In patients with cardiac or renal disease, acentral venous pressure (CVP) line is mandatory to control fluid balance. Regular moni-toring of plasma potassium is essential, as it may fall very rapidly as glucose enters cells.Insulin therapy is given by intravenous infusion adjusted according to blood glucose levels.A nasogastric tube is essential to prevent aspiration of gastric contents, and a bladder catheterto measure urine production. Antibiotics and local wound care should be given to treatthis man\u2019s foot ulcer. In the longer-term it is important that this patient and his wife areeducated about his diabetes and that he has regular access to diabetes services. His smok-ing and alcohol consumption will also need to be addressed.

        "Answer": " 90The most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD). The physicalsigns and chest X-ray indicate overinflation. The early inspiratory crackles are typical ofCOPD.Treatment with bronchodilators should be pursued looking at the effect of /H92522-agonists andanticholinergic agents, judging the effect from the patient\u2019s symptoms and exercise toler-ance rather than spirometry. Theophylline may sometimes be useful as a third-line ther-apy but has more side-effects.With this degree of severity, inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators (sal-meterol/formoterol or tiotropium) would be appropriate inhaled therapy. Careful attentionwould need to be given to inhaler technique.He is cyanosed and has signs of right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). Blood gasesshould be checked to see if he might be a candidate for long-term home-oxygen therapy(known to improve survival if the pressure of arterial oxygen (paO2) in the steady-statebreathing air remains/H110217. Gentle diuresis might help the oedema although oxygenwould be a better approach if he is sufficiently hypoxic. Annual influenza vaccinationshould be recommended and Streptococcus pneumoniaevaccination should be given.Antibiotics might be kept at home for infective exacerbations.Exercise tolerance will be reduced by his obesity and by lack of muscle use. A weight-reducing diet should be started. If he has the motivation to continue exercising, then apulmonary rehabilitation programme has been shown to increase exercise tolerance byaround 20 per cent and to improve quality of life. Other more dramatic interventions suchas lung-reduction surgery or transplantation might be considered in a younger patient.Depression is often associated with the poor exercise tolerance and social isolation, andthis should be considered.COPD is often regarded as a condition where treatment has little to offer. However, a vig-orous approach tailored to the need of the individual patient can provide a worthwhilebenefit.\n228In COPD /H92522-agonists and anticholinergic agents produce similar effects or a greaterresponse from anticholinergics. The combination may be helpful. In contrast, in asthma/H92522-agonists produce a greater effect.Assessment for home oxygen should be made in a stable state on optimal inhaled therapy.Exercise and diet are important elements in the management of COPD.Depression is common in chronic conditions such as COPD"

        "Examination": "His blood pressure is 136/84 mmHg. The respiratory, cardiovascular and abdominal systemsare normal. There is a 3 cm ulcerated area with a well-demarcated edge on the dorsum ofthe right foot. The posterior tibial pulses are palpable on both feet, and the dorsalis pedison the left. The capillary return time is 4 s. On neurological examination there is some lossof light touch sensation in the toes.

        "Answer": " 91The presence of varicose veins raises the possibility of a venous ulcer related to poorvenous return. However, venous ulcers are usually found around the medial malleolus andare often associated with skin changes of chronic venous insufficiency. This has the fea-tures of an ulcer caused by arterial rather than venous ulceration or a mixed aetiology.Arterial ulcers are often on the dorsum of the foot. Arterial ulcers tend to be deeper andmore punched out in appearance. The left dorsalis pedis pulse is not palpable and the capil-lary return time is greater than the normal value of 2 s. The story of pain in the legs onwalking requires a little more detail but it is suggestive of intermittent claudication relatedto insufficient blood supply to the exercising calf muscles.The raised HbA1csuggests diabetes and prolonged hyperglycaemia. In diabetes the arterialinvolvement may be in small vessels with greater preservation of the pulses. The periph-eral sensory neuropathy may also be associated with diabetes and lead to unrecognizedtrauma to the skin which then heals poorly. Other risk factors for arterial disease are thefamily history and the history of smoking.Further investigations would include measurement of the ankle:brachial blood pressureratio. If this is less than 0.97 it suggests arterial disease, and a low index would be a con-traindication to pressure treatment in trying to heal the ulcer.Ultrasonic angiology would help to identify the anatomy of the arterial circulation in thelower limbs and would show if there are correctable narrowings of major vessels. Goodcontrol of diabetes can slow progression of complications such as neuropathy andmicrovascular disease. Care of the feet is a very important part of the treatment of dia-betes and should be a regular element of follow-up.\n230The position and nature of ulcers provide clues to their cause.Diabetic feet are particularly vulnerable because of sensory loss, arterial insufficiencyand high sugars. Foot care is an important element of regular diabetic management"

        "Answer": " 93This 79-year-old man has the clinical features of aortic stenosis and regurgitation. Themurmurs are of mixed aortic valve disease and the ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy(sum of negative deflection in V1 and positive deflection in V5 or V2 and V6 greater than35 mm), suggesting that there has been significant pressure overload from aortic stenosis.The findings of mixed aortic valve disease, microscopic haematuria, malaise and fever(probable with the night sweats) make infective endocarditisa likely diagnosis. This wouldfit with the haematological picture showing a normocytic anaemia, a raised neutrophilcount and a high ESR. In the elderly, infective endocarditis may be an insidious illness andshould be considered in any patient who has murmurs and fever or any other change in thecardiac signs or symptoms. The other classical findings of splenomegaly, splinter haemor-rhages, clubbing, Osler\u2019s nodes, Janeway lesions and Roth\u2019s spots are often absent.Precipitating events such as dental treatment or other sources of bacteraemia may not beevident in the history.It is difficult to tie all the features into any other single diagnosis. The signs are of aorticvalve disease. When there is a fever or other evidence of infection in the presence of valvedisease, infective endocarditis must always be considered although in practice other unre-lated infections are more common. Other infections such as tuberculosis or abscess arepossible or an underlying lymphoma or other malignancy.The most important investigations would be:blood cultures performed before any antibiotics are given. In this case three blood cul-tures grew Streptococcus viridansechocardiogram which showed a thickened bicuspid aortic valve, a common congeni-tal abnormality predisposing to significant functional valve disturbance in middle andold age. Vegetations can be detected on a transthoracic echocardiogram if they areprominent, but transoesophageal echocardiogram is more sensitive in detecting vege-tations on the valves.Treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin for 2 weeks, followed by oralamoxicillin resulted in resolution of the fever with no haemodynamic deterioration orchange in the murmurs of mixed aortic valve disease. A microbiologist should be con-sulted about appropriate antibiotics and duration.After treatment of the endocarditis, the symptoms of pain and tiredness on exertion wouldneed to be considered to see if valve surgery was indicated. Prior to this it would be rou-tine to look at the coronary arteries by angiography to see if simultaneous coronary arterysurgery was needed.Symptoms on exertion in aortic valve disease are a sign that valve surgery needs to beconsidered.In infective endocarditis, it is unusual to have many of the classical physical signs. In theelderly, it may present with non-specific malaise"

The abdominal X-ray showed no gas under the diaphragm and no dilated loopsof bowel or fluid levels. While under observation, the urine output fell off. Re-examinationshowed that bowel sounds were absent. Her hands and feet remained warm. Measurementsof cardiac output in ICU showed that it remained high.1Chart from intensive care unit ",
        "Answer": " 94One diagnosis of the abdominal pain which would explain her condition and fit with herpredisposing situation is ischaemic bowelcaused by an embolus from the heart. The patientis likely to become very ill without markedly abnormal physical signs. Atrial fibrillationincreases the likelihood of such an event. She has been on aspirin which will reduce slightlythe risk of embolic events, but not on anticoagulants which would have decreased the riskfurther. In the presence of pre-existing cardiovascular problems, shown by the hypertensionand angina, anticoagulation would normally be started if there are no contraindications. Therisk of cerebrovascular accidents caused by emboli from the heart has been shown to bereduced. In lone atrial fibrillation with no underlying cardiac disease the risks of emboli andthe benefits of anticoagulation are less. There are alternative diagnoses such as perforationor pancreatitis, and it is not possible to be sure of the cause of the abdominal problem fromthe information given here. After the first hour or two the cen-tral venous pressure drops, the blood pressure falls and the pulse rate rises in associationwith the fall in urine output.These findings show that she is developing shock with inadequate perfusion of vital organs.\n238Types of shock ExampleHypovolaemic shock Blood lossCardiogenic shock Myocardial infarctionExtracardiac obstructive shock Pulmonary embolismVasodilatory (distributive) shock SepsisPossible causes for shock!All these causes are possible in this woman with abdominal problems and a history ofischaemic heart disease. The fact that the cardiac output is high makes blood loss and cardiogenic shock unlikely. The most likely cause is septic shock where peripheral vasodi-latation would lead to a high cardiac output but a falling blood pressure and rising pulserate. Vasoconstriction and reduced blood flow occurs in certain organs, such as the kid-neys, leading to the term \u2018distributive shock\u2019 with maintained overall cardiac output butinappropriate distribution of blood flow. The rise in central temperature and the lack of amarked fall in peripheral temperature would fit with this cause of the shock.The patient was stabilized with fluid replacement and antibiotics before going to theatrewhere the diagnosis of ischaemic bowel from an embolus was confirmed. Arteriographycan confirm the diagnosis but confirmation is often at laparotomy which is usuallyrequired to remove the necrotic bowel.Aspirin and anticoagulation should be considered in patients with atrial fibrillation.Septic shock may be present with warm peripheries through vasodilatation.A drop in the central venous pressure may be the first sign of developing shock"

        "History": "A 66-year-old woman notices that she is having trouble performing some everyday taskssuch as doing up buttons on her blouse and chopping up vegetables in her cooking. Shecomplains that her muscles feel stiff, and it is taking her longer than it did to walk to thelocal shops. She is anxious about these problems since she lives alone and has to do every-thing for herself. She has noticed a little shakiness which she ascribes to anxiety. Herdaughter has told her that it is becoming increasingly difficult to read the small writing inthe letters she sends. She is a retired journalist and has no significant past medical history.There is no disturbance of her bowels or micturition. Her appetite has been good and herweight steady. She complains that she has been sleeping poorly and is, consequently, rathertired. She does not smoke tobacco and drinks only occasionally. She has hypertension andtakes atenolol 50 mg daily.",
        "Examination": "Her pulse is 60/min and regular, blood pressure is 134/84 mmHg. There are no abnormalitiesin the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. On neurological examination there is no musclewasting. She has generally increased muscle tone throughout the range of movement andequal in flexors and extensors. There is a slight tremor affecting mainly her right hand,which is suppressed when she tries to do something. She has problems with fine tasks suchas doing up buttons. Power, reflexes, co-ordination and sensation are all normal. When askedto walk she is a little slow to get started and has difficulty stopping and turning ",
        "Answer": " 95There is evidence in the history and examination of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. Herwriting shows micrographia secondary to the rigidity and slowness of movement. Her hyper-tension is well controlled on the beta-blocker. Beta-blockers can cause tiredness and slownessbut not to the extent seen in this woman. This woman has Parkinson\u2019s diseasepresenting withthe classic triad of tremor, rigidity and hypokinesia. Tremor is usually an early symptom andmay be unilateral. The combination of tremor with rigidity leads to the cogwheel form of rigid-ity. The patient often goes on to have a blank mask-like facies. There is difficulty starting towalk (freezing) and the patient uses small steps and has difficulty stopping (festination). Thereis generally normal intellectual function, but there is often depression. Sleep is often disturbedcontributing to daytime tiredness. The characteristic pathological abnormality is degenerationof dopamine-secreting neurones in the nigrostriatal pathway of the basal ganglia.Parkinsonian features (parkinsonism) may occur in a variety of diseases:Parkinson\u2019s diseasepostencephalitic parkinsonismneuroleptic drug-induced Parkinson\u2019s diseaseparkinsonism in association with Alzheimer\u2019s/multi-infarct dementia.\n240Rest tremor: the tremor is worse at rest and is typical of parkinsonism.Postural tremor: this is characteristic of benign essential tremor, physiologicaltremor and exaggerated physiological tremor caused by anxiety, alcohol andthyrotoxicosis. Benign essential tremor is not present at rest, but appears onholding the arms outstretched but is not worse on movement (finger\u2013nose testing).Tests of co-ordination are normal and walking is unaffected. There is usually afamily history of tremor and the tremor is helped by alcohol and beta-blockers.Intention tremor: the tremor is worse on movement and is most obvious infinger\u2013nose testing. It is usually caused by brainstem or cerebellar disease caused bysuch diseases as multiple sclerosis, localized tumours or spinocerebellar degeneration.Classification of tremor!\nA variety of drugs are available to treat this woman\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease. Selegiline, aninhibitor of monoamine oxidase B may delay the need to start levodopa and may slow therate of progression of the disease, but has significant side-effects. Levodopa is usually usedin combination with a selective dopa decarboxylase inhibitor which does not cross theblood\u2013brain barrier and reduces peripheral adverse effects. The commonest side-effectsare nausea, vomiting, dizziness, postural hypotension and neuropsychiatric problems. Aftermany years of treatment the effects tend to diminish and the patient may develop rapidoscillations in control \u2013 the \u2018on\u2013off\u2019 effect. When these develop, a sustained release for-mulation of levodopa or a dopamine agonist, e. bromocriptine, may produce improve-ment. Because of the loss of effect with time, treatment should not be started too early.This requires careful discussion with the individual patient. She should be assessed by aphysiotherapist and occupational therapist and provided with advice and aids. With timeher house may need to be altered to aid her mobility.Parkinson\u2019s disease is characterized by tremor, rigidity and hypokinesia.Patient management is long term and multidisciplinary.Benefits of levodopa treatment in Parkinson\u2019s disease may lessen with time This page intentionally left blank"

        "Answer": " 97The obvious abnormal investigation is a very high serum cholesterol with high LDL andlow HDL levels. He has many clinical features to go with the high cholesterol and prema-ture vascular disease. This man has familial hypercholesterolaemia. He has presentedwith premature coronary artery disease. His absent pedal pulses suggest peripheral vasculardisease. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an autosomal dominant condition. The homo-zygous condition is rare and affected individuals usually die before the age of 20 years dueto premature atherosclerosis. The heterozygous form affects about 1 in 400 individuals inthe UK, and 50 per cent of males will develop ischaemic heart disease before the age of 50years. Corneal arcus, xanthelasmata and xanthomata on Achilles tendons and the exten-sor tendons on the dorsum of the hands develop in early adult life. The metabolic defectis a result of a reduced number of high-affinity cell-surface LDL receptors. This leads toincreased LDL levels. Increased uptake of LDL by macrophage scavenger receptors leads toincreased oxidized LDL, which is particularly atherogenic. Triglyceride and VLDL levelsare normal or mildly elevated. HDL levels are low. The other major causes of hypercho-lesterolaemia are familial combined hyperlipidaemia and polygenic hypercholesterol-aemia. Familial combined hyperlipidaemia differs from familial hypercholesterolaemia bypatients having raised triglycerides. Patients with polygenic hypercholesterolaemia have asimilar lipid profile to familial hypercholesterolaemia but they do not develop xanthomata.Hypercholesterolaemia may commonly occur in hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, nephroticsyndrome and hepatic cholestasis.This patient is at extremely high risk for further vascular events and especially occlusionof his coronary artery bypass grafts. His risk depends on the combination of his risk fac-tors, and all of these need attention. He should be advised to stop smoking, reduce hisalcohol intake (which is also affecting his liver as judged from the raised gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase), take more exercise and eat a strict low-cholesterol diet. Diet alone will notcontrol this level of cholesterol. He should have pharmacological treatment with a statinbut may need combined treatment for this level of hyperlipidaemia. His children shouldhave their lipid profile measured so that they can be treated to prevent premature cor-onary artery disease. There is clear evidence from clinical trials that primary preventionof coronary artery disease can be achieved by lowering serum cholesterol. The West ofScotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) showed cholesterol lowering withpravastatin reduced both the number of coronary events and coronary mortality in middle-aged men with a serum LDL level of greater than 4 mmol/L. In patients who have evidenceof cardiovascular disease secondary prevention is even more important, aiming for a cho-lesterol level as low as possible. Statins are well tolerated although myositis is a rare butserious complication.\n246The commonest causes for hypercholesterolaemia are polygenic hypercholesterolaemia,familial hypercholesterolaemia and familial combined hyperlipidaemia.Effective drugs are now available to treat hypercholesterolaemia and should be usedaggressively to reduce coronary artery disease.In secondary prevention the aim is the lowest possible cholesterol level"

        "History": "A 66-year-old man has been persuaded by his wife to go to his general practitioner (GP).She is worried that he has changed. Over the last 4 weeks he has become lethargic andrather vague. He has a 12-year history of chronic cough and sputum production, but shethinks that these symptoms may have increased a little over the last 8 weeks. He hassmoked 20 cigarettes daily for the last 50 years and he drinks around 14 units of alcoholper week. Two years ago he became depressed and was treated with an antidepressant for6 months with good effect. She cannot remember the name of the medication. He hadworked all his life as a postman until retirement 6 years ago.",
        "Examination": "He is a little vague in his answers to questions. There are no abnormalities to find in thecardiovascular, respiratory or abdominal systems. There is no lymphadenopathy. On neuro-logicalexamination he seems to have mild generalized muscle weakness. Reflexes, toneand sensation are all normal. His peak flow and spirometry are within normal limits.\n247\nNormalHaemoglobin 14.0 g/dLMean corpuscular volume (MCV) 86 fL 80\u201399 fLWhite cell count 6.0/H11003109/LPlatelets 297/H11003109/L 150\u2013400/H11003109/LSodium 119 mmol/L 135\u2013150 mmol/LPotassium 3 ",
        "Answer": " 98The blood results show hyponatraemia and the chest X-ray shows a mass overlying theright hilum. This degree of hyponatraemia might be expected to cause some cerebralchanges. A lower level might be associated with fits. Above 120\u2013125 mmol/L the effectsare likely to be non-specific tiredness.Possible causes for the hyponatraemia in this man are:inappropriate argenine vasopressin (AVP, antidiuretic hormone) secretion found inassociation with the respiratory disorders of undifferentiated small-cell carcinoma ofthe lung or, occasionally, with pneumonia or tuberculosisAddison\u2019s disease (adrenocortical failure) which would be expected to produce a highpotassium level and postural hypotension. Addison\u2019s disease might be linked with respiratory problems through adrenal involvement by metastases or tuberculosis.Other causes such as diuretic treatment, inappropriate AVP from drug therapy (e. carba-mazepine, phenothiazines, amitriptyline), cerebrovascular events, salt-losing nephropathiesor overhydration from intravenous fluids or overdrinking are not likely from the story givenhere. He has been treated with antidepressants, but not for the last 18 months. In view of thechest X-ray the most likely diagnosis is inappropriate AVP secretion with a small-cellundifferentiated carcinoma of the lung. This can be confirmed by measurement of serumand urine osmolarities to show serum dilution while the urine is concentrated. Levels of AVPcan be measured.In this case, the osmolarities confirmed the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hor-mone (SIADH) secretion; bronchial biopsies at fibreoptic bronchoscopy showed a small-cellundifferentiated carcinoma. Extension to the carina and computed tomography (CT)appearances showed it to be not resectable. Fluid restriction to 750 mL daily produced anincrease in serum sodium to 128 mmol/L with improvement in the confusion and weakness.If this fails to produce adequate results demeclocycline can be used. This derivative oftetracycline antibiotics interferes with the action of ADH in the renal tubules.Chemotherapy was started for the lung tumour. Such treatment often produces a responsein terms of shrinkage of the tumour, improved quality of life and increased survival. Itmay also help the ectopic hormone secretion. Unfortunately, cure is still infrequent.Small-cell undifferentiated carcinomas of the lung are fast-growing tumours, usuallyunresectable at presentation.\n248Change of character may have a metabolic explanation.The commonest cause of hyponatraemia is diuretic therapy.Measurement of serum and urine osmolarities can help to determine the cause ofhyponatraemia This page intentionally left blank"

She smokes 15 cigarettes per day and drinks about 14 units of alcohol each week.Her 20-year-old son has asthma and she has tried his salbutamol inhaler on two or threeoccasions but found it to be of no real benefit. She has tested herself on her son\u2019s peakflow meter at home and she has obtained values of about 100 L/min. On direct question-ing she says that the shortness of breath tends to be worse on lying down but there are noother particular precipitating factors or variations through the day. She works as an officecleaner and has no significant previous medical history.",
        "Examination": "Her respiratory rate is 18 per minute. Pulse rate is 72/min and blood pressure 138/84 mmHg.The heart sounds are normal. There is a generalized wheeze heard all over the chest but noother abnormalities. Results are as follows:Actual Post-bronchodilator PredictedFEV1(L) 1.4FER (FEV1/FVC) (%) 29 29 72\u201380PEF (L/min) 80 80 440\u2013540Residual volume (L) 1.8Total lung capacity (L) 5.0FEV1: forced expiratory volume in 1 s; FVC, forced vital capacity; FER, forced expiratoryratio; PEF, peak expiratory flow Flow\u2013volume loop ",
        "Answer": " 99The flow\u2013volume curve shows the same low flow throughout the whole volume of the vitalcapacity. This situation is typical of a rigid large-airway obstruction. It is not reversiblewith bronchodilator therapy. The spirometry trace of volume against time in such casesshows a straight line of the same reduced flow right up to the vital capacity. These findingsare typical of a narrowing in a larger airway. On examination, this airway narrowing is likely to produce a single monophonic wheeze which may be heard over a wide area ofthe chest.3Flow\u2013volume loop: intrathoracicnarrowing.4Flow\u2013volume loop: extrathoracicnarrowing.!The situation may easily be confused with asthma if the peak flow and the wheezingare accepted uncritically. In asthma, the spirometry will show a reduced FEV1but theflow rate (and therefore the slope of the line relating volume and time) will vary. Thewheezing in asthma comes from many narrowed airways of different calibre andmass, and the wheezes are often described as polyphonic.Differential diagnosis of rigid large-airway obstruction\nThe fixed flow in inspiration and expiration in this case suggest a rigid large-airway nar-rowing. If it is outside the thoracic cage,as in a laryngeal lesion, it will be more evident on inspiration. If the site is intrathoracic,the flow limitation will be greater in expiration. Large-airway narrowing can be causedby inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis or Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis, damagefrom prolonged endotracheal intubation or by extrinsic pressure such as a retrosternalgoitre. However, the commonest cause is a carcinoma of a large airway Some further investigation of the large airways is required. The great majority of symp-tomatic lung tumours are visible on plain chest X-ray but central lesions in large airwaysmay not be seen. Further investigation could be a bronchoscopy or a computed tomog-raphy (CT) scan. A bronchoscopy to see and biopsy any lesion would be best. In this case,fibre-optic bronchoscopy showed a carcinoma in the lower trachea reducing the lumen toa small orifice. Treatment was by radiotherapy with oral steroids to cover any initialswelling of the tumour which might increase the degree of obstruction in the trachea.\n253Large-airway narrowing produces characteristic findings on visual displays of respiratoryfunction but is more difficult to identify from the numbers alone.A small proportion of central lung tumours may present with local symptoms but a nor-mal chest X-ray"

        "History": "A 22-year-old woman is admitted to hospital with a painful left leg. She uses intravenousdrugs and injects into veins in the arms and the groins. The left leg has become swollenand painful over the last week. She has had two previous admissions to hospital withinthe last 6 months, once for an overdose of heroin and once for an infection in the left arm.She smokes 20 cigarettes daily and drinks up to 40 units of alcohol per week.",
        "Examination": "Her pulse is 84/min and regular. Her blood pressure is 124/74 mmHg. Her temperature is37. The heart sounds are normal and there are no abnormal findings on examinationof the respiratory system. She has a swollen left calf with some local tenderness. There arepuncture sites in both groins but no obvious sepsis.\n254\nNormalHaemoglobin 12.7 g/dLWhite cell count 10.0/H11003109/LPlatelets 154/H11003109/L 150\u2013440/H11003109/LSodium 137 mmol/L 135\u2013145 mmol/LPotassium 3.7 mmol/LCreatinine 74/H9262mol/L 70\u2013120/H9262mol/LUltrasound of left leg: venous thrombus extending into the left femoral vein\nVenous access is difficult but a line is inserted in the right arm and she is treated with sub-cutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin, intravenous vitamins and benzodiazepines, anda methadone-replacement regime.

        "Answer": " 100The initial diagnosis was a deep vein thrombosis. This complication is not unusual inintravenous drug users and can be associated with sepsis although there was no sign ofthis on the initial investigations. She has been treated for the thrombosis and for alcoholwithdrawal and her opiate use.There are a number of possibilities for her acute deterioration. The deep vein thrombosiswould have predisposed her to a pulmonary embolus, but the normal respiratory rate, lackof elevation of jugular venous pressure and normal oxygen saturation make this unlikely.As an intravenous drug user she might have taken more drugs even under supervision inhospital.The tachycardia and lowered blood pressure raise the possibility of haemorrhage whichmight be precipitated by the anticoagulants. However, the raised CRP, white cell count andabnormal electrolytes in a warm, well-perfused patient suggest sepsisas the likely cause.In an intravenous drug user one would think of infective endocarditis which may occur onthe valves of the right side of the heart and be more difficult to diagnose. Lung abscessesfrom septic emboli are another possibility in an intravenous drug user with a deep veinthrombosis, and a chest X-ray should be taken although the lack of respiratory symptomsmakes this less likely. In this case the intravenous line has been left in place longer thanusual because of the difficulties of intravenous access and it has become infected. Linesshould be inspected every day, changed regularly and removed as soon as possible. Theprevious hospital admissions raise then possibility of infections such as methicillin-reistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA). In this case MRSA was found in blood cultures and treatedwith intravenous vancomycin with good effect.On recovery and discharge there were problems with the question of anticoagulation.Warfarin treatment raised difficulties because of the unreliability of dosing, attendance atanticoagulant clinics and blood sampling. It was decided to continue treatment as an out-patient with subcutaneous heparin for 6 weeks.\n256Patients using intravenous drugs often pose problems in venous access, and sampling fortests such as international normalized ratio (INR).Indwelling venous lines should be changed regularly and removed as soon as possible abdominal pain/discomfort 5(14\u201316),32(89\u201390), 36(98\u20139), 41(109\u201310),43(113\u201314), 69(179\u201380), 72(185\u20136),77(195\u20136), 81(205\u20136), 94(237\u20138)abdominal sepsis, postoperative 42(112)achalasia of the cardia 55(145\u20136)Addison\u2019s disease and Addisonian crisis seeadrenocortical failureadenoma, pituitary 11(28)ADHseearginine vasopressinadrenocortical failure (Addison\u2019s disease)98(248)acute, steroid-induced 71(183\u20134)AIDSseeHIV infectionairway obstructionchronic 90(226\u20138)large, rigid, differential diagnosis 99(252)alcoholic liver disease 7(19\u201320)aldosterone deficiency 71(183\u20134)amenorrhoea 30(83\u20134)aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity 42amnesia 62(163\u20134)amyloidosis 22(59\u201361)anaemiairon-deficiency 81(206)macrocytic, causes/differential diagnosis18(46), 54(144)microcytic 81(206)in sickle cell disease 40(108)ankle swelling 22(59\u201361)anorexia and fever 8(21\u20132)anorexia nervosa 30(83\u20134)antidiuretic hormone seearginine vasopressinaortic valve disease 93(236)appendicitis, acute 41(109\u201310)arginine vasopressin (ADH; antidiuretichormone; vasopressin)inadequate secretion 154inappropriate secretion 79(200), 98(248)arterial ulcer, foot 91(229\u201330)arteritis, giant cell 82(207\u20138)arthritisdifferential diagnosis of monoarthritis15(38)reactive 15(38\u20139)rheumatoid 27(75\u20137)septicseeseptic arthritisascorbic acid (vitamin C) deficiency52(137\u20138)asthma 4(11\u201312)atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis 37(100)autoimmune thyroid disease 88(222)autonomic neuropathy, diabetic 87(220)back pain 10(25\u20136), 31(86\u20138), 67(174\u20135)bacterial meningitis 76(193\u20134)biliary disorders 5(14\u201316), 69(179\u201380),77(195\u20136), 88(221\u20132)blackout seeconsciousness, lossbleeding oesophageal varices 7(20)blisters 39(105\u20136)blood, urine seehaematuriablood pressure seehypertension; hypotensionbone disease, metabolic 31(86\u20138)bowel disorders 6(17\u201318), 32(89\u201390),36(99\u2013100), 38(103\u20134), 41(109\u201310),43(114), 63(165\u20136), 94(237\u20138)breast cancer metastases seemetastasesbreathlessness (dyspnoea) 4(11), 96(241\u20133),99(250\u20133)chest pain and 40(107\u20138), 50(130\u20133),78(187\u20138)cough and 90(226\u20138)on exertion 24(65\u20136)fever and 25(68\u201370)tiredness and headaches and 18(45\u20136)bronchiectasis 3(10)bruising, easy 17(43\u20134)bullae (blisters) 39(105\u20136)calcium disturbances 12(32)calculiseestonescancerseemalignant tumours; metastasescarbon monoxide poisoning 75(191\u20132)carcinoid tumor 43(113\u201314)carcinomabreast, metastases seemetastasescolon 6(17\u201318)lung 98(248), 99(252, 253)pancreas 69(179\u201380)skin 68(177\u20138)cardia, gastric (upper part of stomach)achalasia 55(145\u20136)tear (/H11005Mallory\u2014Weiss lesion) 84(211\u201312)INDEXReferences are by case number with relevant page number(s) following in brackets.
